    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study investigated which body position is more useful for visualizing subphrenic hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) during ultrasonography (US) examinations. Methods: This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Twenty consecutive patients with a single subphrenic HCC (treatment-naïve, 1 to 3 cm) underwent a US examination for planning radiofrequency ablation. The examinations were done by one of three radiologists and the patients were examined in four different body positions-supine, right posterior oblique (RPO), left lateral decubitus (LLD), and semi-erect-by being positioned on a tilted table. The visibility of the index tumor was prospectively assessed using a 4-point scale. Needle insertion was considered to be technically feasible if the visibility score was lower than 2. The visibility score and technical feasibility were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the McNemar test, respectively, for pairwise comparisons between different body positions. Results: The visibility score was significantly lower in the semi-erect position (median, 2; interquartile range, 1 to 2.75) than in the supine (3, 2 to 4), RPO (3, 2 to 4), and LLD (4, 3.25 to 4) positions (P=0.007, P=0.005, and P=0.001, respectively). The technical feasibility of needle insertion was also significantly higher in the semi-erect position (75%, 15/20) than in the supine (45%, 9/45), RPO (35%, 7/20), and LLD (20%, 4/20) positions (P=0.031, P=0.021, and P=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: The semi-erect position is more useful for the visualization of subphrenic HCCs than the supine, RPO, or LLD positions.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the effects of microRNA-122 (miR-122) on proliferation, migration, and invasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways. Methods: miR-122 mimics, miR-122 inhibitors, relevant control oligonucleotides, and Wnt1 were transfected into HepG2 and huh7 cell lines which were then divided into six groups: miR-122 group, anti-miR-122 group, miR-negative control (NC) group, anti-miR-NC group, miR-122 + Wnt1 group, and miR-122 + vector group. The miR-122 expressions and mRNA expressions of Wnt1 and EMT-related genes (E-cadherin, vimentin, β-cadherin, and N-cadherin) were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Protein expression levels of Wnt1, E-cadherin, vimentin, β-cadherin, and N-cadherin were measured by Western blot. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, wound-healing assay, and Transwell assay, respectively. Results: Dual luciferase reporter gene results showed that Wnt1 is a direct target gene of miR-122 in both HepG2 and huh7 cell lines. Compared to miR-NC, anti-miR-NC, and miR-122 + Wnt1 groups, miR-122 expression was markedly higher in the miR-122 group and miR-122 + vector group, but was sharply decreased in anti-miR-122 group (both P<0.05), and the mRNA and protein levels of Wnt1, vimentin, β-cadherin, and N-cadherin decreased significantly; also E-cadherin increased, and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion decreased in the miR-122 group and miR-122 + vector group (all P<0.05), but the situation was totally reversed in the anti-miR-122 group (all P<0.05). Conclusion: Downregulation of miR-122 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of human HCC cells by targeting Wnt1 and regulating Wnt/β-catenin pathway which activated the EMT pathways.",

    "Abstract": "Background: It has been suggested that hospitalized patients may get suboptimal care in nights or on weekends or summer holidays due to sleep deprivation, physician fatigue, or reduced medical staffing. Our objective was to determine whether there were differences in outcomes when surgery was performed in the night (10 pm-6 am), on weekends (Saturday or Sunday), or during summer months (June-August). Methods: We used United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data sets of adults transplanted between February 27, 2002, and September 30, 2016. We estimated the start time of liver transplant surgery by utilizing the cross-clamp time and cold ischemia time (cross-clamp time + cold ischemia time - 2 h). The survival outcomes were estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were analyzed separately. The independent effect of time of transplant on outcomes was analyzed after adjusting for common confounders, including Model for End-stage Liver Diseases scores and transplant center volume. Results: During the study period, 4 434 (9.6%) were done in the night, 12 147 (26.4%) over weekends, and 11 976 (26%) during summer months. The graft and patient survival and complications were not influenced by the time of transplant for both HCC and non-HCC population. Cox regression analysis after adjusting for risk factors, including Model for End-stage Liver Diseases, donor risk index, and liver center volume, confirmed that there were no significant differences in outcomes. Conclusions: Our study showed that the time of transplant surgery whether done during nights, weekends, or summer months had no effect on graft or patient survival irrespective of center volume, patient, or donor risk factors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the prognosis and complications of liver cirrhosis is not fully clarified. Aim: To clarify the mortality and related risk factors as well as complications in cirrhotic patients with T2DM. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from their inception to December 1, 2020 for cohort studies comparing liver transplant-free mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), variceal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhotic patients with vs without T2DM. Odds ratios (ORs) were combined by using fixed-effects or random-effects models with RevMan software. Results: The database search generated a total of 17 cohort studies that met the inclusion criteria. Among these studies, eight reported the risk of mortality, and eight reported the risk of HCC. Three studies provided SBP rates, and two documented ascites rates. Four articles focused on HE rates, and three focused on variceal bleeding rates. Meta-analysis indicated that T2DM was significantly associated with an increased risk of liver transplant-free mortality [OR: 1.28, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.16-1.41, P < 0.0001] and HCC incidence (OR: 1.82, 95%CI: 1.32-2.51, P = 0.003). The risk of SBP was not significantly increased (OR: 1.16 95%CI: 0.86-1.57, P = 0.34). Additionally, T2DM did not significantly increase HE (OR: 1.31 95%CI: 0.97-1.77, P = 0.08), ascites (OR: 1.11 95%CI: 0.84-1.46, P = 0.46), and variceal bleeding (OR: 1.34, 95%CI: 0.99-1.82, P = 0.06). Conclusion: The findings suggest that cirrhotic patients with T2DM have a poor prognosis and high risk of HCC. T2DM may not be associated with an increased risk of SBP, variceal bleeding, ascites, or HE in cirrhotic patients with T2DM.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: To investigate the expression and prognostic value of α1-ACT (Alpha1-antichymotrypsin) in patients with HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and identify the mechanism by which α1-ACT inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of HCC. Methods: We first measured α1-ACT expression levels and determined their relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with HCC.We then established stable HCC cell lines with both α1-ACT overexpression and knockdown and performed a functional analysis in vitro.We first examined the relationship between α1-ACT and the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway using Western blotting. Then, we determined whether α1-ACT can directly bind to PTEN using co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, we measured α1-ACT expression to evaluate its correlation with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related apoptosis proteins in a xenograft tumour mouse model using immunohistochemistry. Results: The α1-ACT expression level was significantly lower in the HCC tissues than in the paratumour tissues and was negatively positively correlated with the level of Ki67, AFP, the AJCC stage, tumour size and tumour invasion. The overexpression of α1-ACT can inhibit cell proliferation and increase cell apoptosis by activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated apoptosis via binding to PTEN and activating it in vitro. Additionally, the overexpression of α1-ACT can also increase the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 stage by increasing cyclin p21 expression and inhibiting the migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells by regulating MMP2 and MMP9. The xenotransplantation studies with nude mice also showed that overexpression of α1-ACT inhibited tumourigenesis and knockdown of α1-ACT had the opposite effect. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that α1-ACT suppresses liver cancer development and metastasis via targeting the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, which may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: We previously showed that the fatty liver formations observed in overfed geese are accompanied by the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and an increase in plasma insulin concentrations. Recent studies have suggested a crucial role for the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in regulating lipid metabolism; therefore, we hypothesized that insulin affects goose hepatocellular lipid metabolism through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Methods: Goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with serum-free media supplemented with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors (LY294002, rapamycin, and NVP-BEZ235, respectively) and 50 or 150 nmol/L insulin. Results: Insulin induced strong effects on lipid accumulation as well as the mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion in primary goose hepatocytes. The stimulatory effect of insulin on lipogenesis was significantly decreased by treatment with PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibitors. These inhibitors also rescued the insulin-induced down-regulation of fatty acid oxidation and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the stimulatory effect of insulin on lipid deposition is mediated by PI3K-Akt-mTOR regulation of lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and VLDL-TG assembly and secretion in goose hepatocytes.",

    "Abstract": "The therapeutic goal which is currently unfrequent but realistic in HBV infected patients is sustained HBsAg clearance. It is preceded by the loss or significant suppression of HBV replication and leads to inhibition of the progression of liver fibrosis, normalization of biochemical indicators of liver damage, reduction in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, prolongation of survival, prevention of HBV infection in the transplanted organ in post-transplant patients, enhancement of the quality of life, inhibition or reversal of extrahepatic changes associated with HBV infection, and halting of the spread of HBV infections. Recommendations of Polish Group of Experts for HBV for 2017 provide guidelines to assess treatment eligibility, choice of the first-line drug, monitoring and duration of treatment, management of treatment failure as well as therapy of HBV associated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover it contains advice for treatment of HBV infection in children, females planning pregnancy or pregnant. We also included recommendations for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, prevention of HBV transmission from mother to infant, after liver transplantation, on immunosuppressive therapy and during HCV treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) overexpression is an important mechanism in acquired epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor gefitinib resistance in lung cancers with EGFR activating mutations. MiR-1-3p and miR-206 act as suppressors in lung cancer proliferation and metastasis. However, whether miR-1-3p and miR-206 can overcome HGF-induced gefitinib resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer is not clear. In this study, we showed that miR-1-3p and miR-206 restored the sensitivities of lung cancer cells PC-9 and HCC-827 to gefitinib in present of HGF. For the mechanisms, we demonstrated that both miR-1-3p and miR-206 directly target HGF receptor c-Met in lung cancer. Knockdown of c-Met mimicked the effects of miR-1-3p and miR-206 transfections Meanwhile, c-Met overexpression attenuated the effects of miR-1-3p and miR-206 in HGF-induced gefitinib resistance of lung cancers. Furthermore, we showed that miR-1-3p and miR-206 inhibited c-Met downstream Akt and Erk pathway and blocked HGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Finally, we demonstrated that miR-1-3p and miR-206 can increase gefitinib sensitivity in xenograft mouse models in vivo. Our study for the first time indicated the new function of miR-1-3p and miR-206 in overcoming HGF-induced gefitinib resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell.",

    "Abstract": "Importance: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has the potential to reveal tumor and germline mutations of clinical relevance, but the diagnostic yield for pediatric patients with solid tumors is unknown. Objective: To characterize the diagnostic yield of combined tumor and germline WES for children with solid tumors. Design: Unselected children with newly diagnosed and previously untreated central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS solid tumors were prospectively enrolled in the BASIC3 study at a large academic children's hospital during a 23-month period from August 2012 through June 2014. Blood and tumor samples underwent WES in a certified clinical laboratory with genetic results categorized on the basis of perceived clinical relevance and entered in the electronic health record. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical categorization of somatic mutations; frequencies of deleterious germline mutations related to patient phenotype and incidental medically-actionable mutations. Results: Of the first 150 participants (80 boys and 70 girls, mean age, 7.4 years), tumor samples adequate for WES were available from 121 patients (81%). Somatic mutations of established clinical utility (category I) were reported in 4 (3%) of 121 patients, with mutations of potential utility (category II) detected in an additional 29 (24%) of 121 patients. CTNNB1 was the gene most frequently mutated, with recurrent mutations in KIT, TSC2, and MAPK pathway genes (BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS) also identified. Mutations in consensus cancer genes (category III) were found in an additional 24 (20%) of 121 tumors. Fewer than half of somatic mutations identified were in genes known to be recurrently mutated in the tumor type tested. Diagnostic germline findings related to patient phenotype were discovered in 15 (10%) of 150 cases: 13 pathogenic or likely pathogenic dominant mutations in adult and pediatric cancer susceptibility genes (including 2 each in TP53, VHL, and BRCA1), 1 recessive liver disorder with hepatocellular carcinoma (TJP2), and 1 renal diagnosis (CLCN5). Incidental findings were reported in 8 (5%) of 150 patients. Most patients harbored germline uncertain variants in cancer genes (98%), pharmacogenetic variants (89%), and recessive carrier mutations (85%). Conclusions and relevance: Tumor and germline WES revealed mutations in a broad spectrum of genes previously implicated in both adult and pediatric cancers. Combined reporting of tumor and germline WES identified diagnostic and/or potentially actionable findings in nearly 40% of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with solid tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer, and most patients present with cancer already spread beyond the lung. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-MET has been implicated in various solid tumors, including SCLC, and is involved in mediating tumorigenesis, cell motility, scattering, invasion and metastasis. Mutations of c-Met have been described in renal papillary carcinoma and gastrointestinal cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma. The sequence of c-MET was examined for possible mutations in the 10 SCLC cell lines and 32 paired-SCLC/normal tissues. Novel c-MET alterations were identified among 3 of 10 separate SCLC cell lines and in 4 of 32 SCLC tumor tissue samples. These include two different c-MET missense mutations in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain (R988C found in NCI-H69 and H249 cell lines; and T1010I in SCLC tumor sample T31). Also, there are one Sema domain missense mutation (E168D in SCLC tumor sample T5), two-base-pair insertional mutations (IVS13- (52-53)insCT in both SCLC tumor samples T26 and T27) within the pre-JM intron 13, as well as an alternative transcript involving exon 10 (H128 cell line). c-MET receptors are expressed at various levels among the 10 SCLC cell lines studied (high expression: H69, H345, H510, and H526; medium-expression: H128 and H146; and low/no-expression: H82, H209, H249, and H446). The level of c-MET expression does not have any apparent correlation with presence or absence of mutations of c-MET in the cell lines. We show that the two identified JM mutations (R988C and T1010I), when introduced into the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent BaF3 cell line, regulated cell proliferation resulting in a small but significant growth factor independence. When introduced into a SCLC cell line (H446, with minimal endogenous wild-type c-MET expression), the JM mutations also regulated cell morphology and adhesion, as well as causing enhanced tumorigenicity by both increases in focus-formation and soft-agar colony-formation assays. Both of the JM mutations also increased cell motility and migration evident in wound healing assay and time-lapse video-microscopy speed analysis. The JM mutations also altered the c-MET RTK signaling, resulting in preferentially increased constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins, including the key focal adhesion protein paxillin on tyrosine residue Y31 (first CRKL-binding site), correlating with increased motility. These results suggest a novel and unique role of the JM domain in c-MET signaling in SCLC with significant implications in cytoskeletal functions and metastatic potential. The novel JM gain-of-function somatic mutations described are the first to be reported in SCLC, and may be associated with a more aggressive phenotype. It would now be useful to study the inhibition of c-MET as a therapeutic target against SCLC.",

    "Abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis are poorly understood. Only very recently has there been a suggestion of familial hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have analyzed the status of the p16INK4(MTS1) gene, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in 26 patients with HCC of different etiologies. Four patients carried hemizygous germ-line point mutations of the p16INK4(MTS1) gene, suggesting the existence of familial HCC involving this gene. The wild-type allele was lost in the tumor in 2 of these 4 patients. Three of the patients carrying a germ-line mutation had non-cirrhosis-associated HCC. No somatic mutations of p16INK4(MTS1) were observed in the 26 cases of HCC. The most common somatic alteration of the p16INK4(MTS1) gene in HCC was de novo methylation, which was detected in 48% of the cases. Low levels (21%) of p16INK4(MTS1) gene allele loss were observed. Altogether, these results indicate that alteration of the p16INK4(MTS1) gene plays an important role in the genesis of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Whether alcohol intake increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of alcohol intake on the development of HCC. Methods: Between January 2006 and August 2008, 146 patients with an initial diagnosis of HCC who were hospitalized in 3 major hospitals in the Incheon area were enrolled as cases. Another 146 cirrhotic patients, who matched the cases by age and sex, were enrolled as controls. All cases and controls were HBsAg positive, and had a history of lifetime alcohol intake. Results: The cases and controls were aged 53±8 and 53±9 years (mean±SD), respectively, with each group comprising 118 males and 28 females. The basal laboratory data, distribution of Child-Pugh class, HBeAg positivity (31.5% vs. 37.7%), HBV DNA level (5.74±2.35 vs. 5.98±2.29 log10 copies/mL), and proportion with a lifetime alcohol intake of more than 292 kg (30.8% vs. 34.9%) did not differ between cases and controls. The cumulative alcohol intake and the proportion of heavy drinkers did not differ between the two groups in male patients. Conclusions: Alcohol intake might not increase the risk of HCC in patients with HBV infection.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: In recent years, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has emerged as an important tool in the identification and characterization of cardiac masses. No imaging data on cardiac masses are available from Pakistan. We aimed to review the clinical presentation, CMR findings, and outcome of patients referred for CMR due to suspicion of cardiac masses on echocardiogram or computed tomography (CT). Material and methods: We reviewed all the patients referred for CMR at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 2011 to March 2020, with the suspicion of cardiac mass on echocardiogram and/or CT. Only those with the confirmed diagnosis of cardiac mass on CMR were included in the study. Results: A total of 27 patients were referred for CMR from January 2011 to March 2020, with the suspicion of cardiac mass on echocardiogram and/or CT. Four patients were excluded as no cardiac mass was found on CMR. Out of 23 cases, majority (n = 15, 65%) were female, age ranging from 3 months to 70 years, with a mean age of 40 ± 22 years. Shortness of breath was the main presenting symptom (n = 19, 83%). Echocardiogram was the initial imaging modality done in all the patients while CT was also performed in 6 patients (26%). Out of 23 patients, 4 (17%) were diagnosed to have thrombus on CMR. In two cases, it was in the left ventricle with evidence of myocardial infarction on late gadolinium images. Myxoma was the most common tumor diagnosed on CMR in 6 patients (26%) followed by rhabdomyoma (n = 3, 13%) and fibroma (n = 2, 8.7%). There were three malignant primary tumors of the heart based on CMR appearances and one with tumor thrombus extension of hepatocellular carcinoma in the right atrium from inferior vena cava. Two patients were diagnosed to have non-neoplastic lesions - one with large intracardiac hydatid cyst and one with possible large fungal vegetation. Among 23 patients, 9 patients (39%) underwent surgery, 5 with myxoma, 2 with rhabdomyoma, 1 with fibroma, and 1 with fibroelastoma. Findings on surgery and histopathology matched the CMR diagnosis in all the patients except the one with the CMR diagnosis of myxoma in which histopathology was consistent with thrombus. Conclusion: CMR can play an important role in confirming the presence or absence of a mass in the heart. It can also provide differentiation of non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions and among different types of neoplastic lesions with reasonable accuracy. However, the limitations of CMR must be recognized.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Germline mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (TCF1/HNF-1alpha) are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), and somatic biallelic inactivations of the gene are found in hepatocellular adenomas and liver adenomatosis. This study investigated cosegregation of HNF-1alpha germline mutations with diabetes and liver adenomatosis in 2 families. Methods: Two unrelated patients with liver adenomatosis and harboring HNF-1alpha germline and somatic mutations were studied. Subsequently, we screened 9 relatives in the 2 independent families for diabetes, hepatocellular adenomas, and HNF-1alpha germline mutations. Results: In family A, a father and his son presented with an intraperitoneal hemorrhagic rupture of a liver adenomatosis without diabetes. A heterozygous R229X germline mutation was identified in HNF-1alpha in the father and his son and also in his second 27-year-old son without hepatocellular adenomas. In family B, a diagnosis of liver adenomatosis was made fortuitously in a 14-year-old girl. A heterozygous G55fsX57 germline mutation in HNF-1alpha was identified in this patient, her diabetic father, and her 2 sisters. Systematic exploration showed liver adenomatosis in the 2 sisters. Somatic inactivation of the second HNF-1alpha allele was found in liver tumors in both families. Conclusions: This study describes familial liver adenomatosis and shows the association with germline HNF-1alpha mutations in adults and children. It also highlights the importance of screening for hepatocellular adenomas, diabetes, and HNF-1alpha germline mutations in relatives of patients with liver adenomatosis. Finally, prevalence of liver adenomatosis remains to be evaluated in MODY3 subjects.",

    "Abstract": "Allelic loss of loci on chromosome 10q occurs frequently in hepatocellular carcinomas. Somatic mutations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene on this chromosome at 10q23 were recently identified in sporadic cancers of the uterus, brain, prostate and breast. To investigate the potential role of PTEN/MMAC1 gene in the genesis of hepatocellular carcinomas, we examined 96 tumors for allelic loss on 10q and also for subtle mutations anywhere within the coding region of PTEN/MMAC1 gene. Allelic loss was identified in 25 of the 89 (27%) tumors that were informative for polymorphic markers in the region. Somatic mutations were identified in five of those tumors: three frameshift mutations, a 1-bp insertion at codon 83-84 in exon 4 and two 4-bp deletions, both at codon 318-319 in exon 8; two C-to-G transversion mutation, both at -9 bp from the initiation codon in the 5' non-coding region of exon 1. No missense mutation was observed in this panel of tumors. In most of the informative tumors carrying intragenic mutations of one allele, we were able to detect loss of heterozygosity as well. These findings suggest that two alleles of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene may be inactivated by a combination of intragenic point mutation on one allele and loss of chromosomal material on the other allele in some of these tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4alpha), the gene for the maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 1 (MODY1) form of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is within the T2DM-linked region on chromosome 20q12-q13.1 and consequently, is a positional candidate gene for T2DM. Mutations in the coding region of HNF-4alpha are rare in diabetes affected subjects. Altered regulation of HNF-4alpha gene expression, controlled by distant enhancer sequences, may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Comparative sequence analysis was performed between 13 kb of genomic DNA 5' to the P1 promoter sequences of the human, mouse, and rat HNF-4alpha coding sequences. Three regions, located at -10.5 kb (295 bp in length), -6.25 kb (421 bp in length), and -5.36 kb (263 bp in length), have significant sequence identity between the species. These three regions were functionally characterized using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter assay, in which the conserved 5' regions of mouse HNF-4alpha were cloned in front of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter driving transcription of the CAT gene. A fragment containing the 421 bp conserved region significantly increased CAT activity in differentiated rat hepatoma cells (13.7-+/-1.9-fold control), while only a modest increase in CAT activity was observed in pancreatic cells (2.5-+/-0.9-fold control; 1.6-+/-0.1-fold control) and dedifferentiated hepatoma cells (1.7-+/-0.4-fold control). The remaining two conserved regions increased CAT activity minimally in pancreatic (1.1-+/-0.1-fold control to 1.9-+/-0.1-fold control) and hepatic (1.6-+/-0.5-fold control to 2.3-+/-0.4-fold control) cell lines. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used to search for sequence variants in DNA from 259 T2DM individuals. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, both of which increased CAT activity in the insulinoma cell lines in the CAT reporter assay (1.4-fold increase over wild-type; 1.7-fold increase over wild-type). These results suggest that comparative sequence analysis can efficiently identify regulatory elements and that sequence variants in regulatory elements of HNF-4alpha can contribute to altered HNF-4alpha gene expression.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Platelet count (PLT) has been proved as an essential biomarker for the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the prognostic value of PLT change (ΔPLT) is still uncertain. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between ΔPLT and HCC survival after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment. Methods: Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for HCC. The non-linear relationship between ΔPLT and OS was estimated through a restricted cubic spline regression analysis, and a two-piece-wise Cox proportional hazard model was further performed to calculate the threshold effect. Results: A total of 597 HCC patients treated with TACE were selected for the secondary analysis. Compared with the ΔPLT within ±20 (×109/L), ΔPLT≥20 (×109/L) was significantly associated with an 64% increase in risk of death (HR, 1.64; 95% CI: 1.21 to 2.22) after adjustment for confounding variables, but the association was not significant in the group of ΔPLT≤-20 (HR, 1.23; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.63). We also found a U-shape relationship between ΔPLT and HCC survival at the turning point of ΔPLT as 0 (20×109/L). The HR for the death was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.18) with ΔPLT≥0 (20×109/L) while 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.98) with ΔPLT<0 (20×109/L). After potential confounding factors were adjusted, the non-linear relationship between ΔPLT and OS was still significant (P=0.013). Besides, ΔPLT≥20 (×109/L) was associated with new lesions (OR, 2.74; 95% CI: 1.38 to 5.45). Conclusion: Elevated PLT was associated with poor overall survival of HCC patients after TACE treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Adjuvant therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) such as interferon-alpha are effective only in a subset of patients. Previously we found that HCC patients with low level of miR-26 have survival benefits from interferon-alpha. The purpose of this study is to develop a standardized miR-26 diagnostic test (referred as MIR26-DX) to assist identification of candidate HCC patients for adjuvant interferon-alpha therapy. Methods: We developed a multiplex reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay to determine the levels of two HCC-related miR-26 transcripts along with six small RNA reference transcripts. We evaluated archived paraffin-embedded tissues from three cohorts of HCC patients (n=248) who underwent radical resection at three different clinical centers. Fifty-two percent of them underwent adjuvant interferon-alpha therapy. We used Cox-Mantel log-rank test to evaluate patient survival. Results: We found that the multiplexing assay was stable and reproducible regardless of differences in sample preparations and operators. We developed a matrix template and a scoring algorithm based on a training cohort (n=129) to assign HCC patients, and then applied the template in two test cohorts (n=119). The proportions of HCC patients assigned as low miR-26 by this algorithm were 68, 4, and 63 percent in the training cohort and two test cohorts, respectively. Consistently, HCC with low miR-26 had a favorable response to interferon-alpha with improved median overall survival (≥3 year). Conclusions: MIR26-DX is a simple and reliable companion diagnostic test to select HCC patients for adjuvant interferon-alpha therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Proliferating cells experience a global reduction of transcription during mitosis, yet their cell identity is maintained and regulatory information is propagated from mother to daughter cells. Mitotic bookmarking by transcription factors has been proposed as a potential mechanism to ensure the reactivation of transcription at the proper set of genes exiting mitosis. Recently, mitotic transcription and waves of transcription reactivation have been observed in synchronized populations of human hepatoma cells. However, the study did not consider that mitotic-arrested cell populations progressively desynchronize leading to measurements of gene expression on a mixture of cells at different internal cell-cycle times. Moreover, it is not well understood yet what is the precise role of mitotic bookmarking on mitotic transcription as well as on the transcription reactivation waves. Ultimately, the core gene regulatory network driving the precise transcription reactivation dynamics remains to be identified. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model to correct for the progressive desynchronization of cells and estimate gene expression dynamics with respect to a cell-cycle pseudotime. Furthermore, we used a multiple linear regression model to infer transcription factor activity dynamics. Our analysis allows us to characterize waves of transcription factor activities exiting mitosis and predict a core gene regulatory network responsible of the transcription reactivation dynamics. Moreover, we identified more than 60 transcription factors that are highly active during mitosis and represent new candidates of mitotic bookmarking factors which could be relevant therapeutic targets to control cell proliferation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Long-term monotherapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) represents the treatment option for the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), an aging population with a greater likelihood of comorbidities. We assessed the prevalence of concurrent non-hepatic diseases and the safety monitoring in a large cohort of CHB patients receiving NAs and their potential impact on disease outcomes. Methods: We included 500 consecutive CHB patients from 5 major tertiary Greek centers, under long-term therapy with an NA. Epidemiological/clinical characteristics and data on concomitant disease, drug use and investigations ordered were collected. Results: The mean age was 58 years and 66% were male. Most patients were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, 60%) or entecavir (ETV, 37%) monotherapy. Decompensated cirrhosis at baseline was present in 10%, while hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under therapy developed in 21 patients. The median duration of total NA therapy was 56 and of latest therapy 42 months. The most common (prevalence >10%) comorbidities were hypertension (28%), non-HCC cancer(s) (12%), and diabetes (11%). Patients with a longer duration of latest therapy (≥4 vs. <4 years) were older (mean age: 58 vs. 56 years, P=0.004), had more frequent history of prior use of NA(s) (53% vs. 35%, P<0.001), and less frequent liver decompensation (5% vs. 13%, P=0.008) and non-HCC cancers (8% vs. 15%, P=0.020). HCC developed more frequently in patients with than in those without diabetes (11% vs. 3%, P=0.022). Conclusion: Greek CHB patients currently treated with NAs, almost exclusively ETV or TDF, are often older than 60 years, have several comorbidities, and thus require careful management.",

In the current study, we investigated tRNA degradation and accumulation in HeLa cells under various forms of stress. We found that initiator tRNA(Met) (tRNA(iMet)) was specifically degraded under heat stress. Two exonucleases, Xrn1 and Xrn2, are involved in the degradation of tRNA(iMet) in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively. In addition to degradation, we observed accumulation of tRNA(iMet) in the nucleus. We also found that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which regulates tRNA trafficking in yeast, is partially phosphorylated at Ser2448 in the presence of rapamycin and/or during heat stress. Our results suggest phosphorylation of mTOR may correlate with accumulation of tRNA(iMet) in heat-treated HeLa cells.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanistic pathways that link both disorders are essentially unknown. Objective: Our study was designed to investigate the role of microRNA-21 in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and its potential involvement in HCC. Methods: Wildtype mice maintained on a high fat diet (HFD) received tail vein injections of microRNA-21-anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) or miR-21 mismatched ASO for 4 or 8 weeks. Livers were collected after that time period for lipid content and gene expression analysis. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells incubated with oleate were used to study the role of miR-21 in lipogenesis and analysed with Nile-Red staining. microRNA-21 function in carcinogenesis was determined by soft-agar colony formation, cell cycle analysis and xenograft tumour assay using HepG2 cells. Results: The expression of microRNA-21 was increased in the livers of HFD-treated mice and human HepG2 cells incubated with fatty acid. MicroRNA-21 knockdown in those mice and HepG2 cells impaired lipid accumulation and growth of xenograft tumour. Further studies revealed that Hbp1 was a novel target of microRNA-21 and a transcriptional activator of p53. It is well established that p53 is a tumour suppressor and an inhibitor of lipogenesis by inhibiting Srebp1c. As expected, microRNA-21 knockdown led to increased HBP1 and p53 and subsequently reduced lipogenesis and delayed G1/S transition, and the additional treatment of HBP1-siRNA antagonised the effect of microRNA-21-ASO, suggesting that HBP1 mediated the inhibitory effects of microRNA-21-ASO on both hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatocarcinogenesis. Mechanistically, microRNA-21 knockdown induced p53 transcription, which subsequently reduced expression of genes controlling lipogenesis and cell cycle transition. In contrast, the opposite result was observed with overexpression of microRNA-21, which prevented p53 transcription. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which microRNA-21, in part, promotes hepatic lipid accumulation and cancer progression by interacting with the Hbp1-p53-Srebp1c pathway and suggest the potential therapeutic value of microRNA-21-ASO for both disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to see whether JAK1, JAK3, and TYK2 genes are altered in human cancers. Experimental design: We analyzed 494 tissues from 186 acute adulthood leukemias, 30 multiple myelomas, and 278 common solid cancers, including 90 breast, 47 gastric, 47 colon, 47 lung, and 47 hepatocellular carcinomas by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Results: Overall, we found six JAK1 mutations (four in acute leukemias, one in a lung carcinoma, and one in a breast carcinoma) and three JAK3 mutations (two in breast carcinomas and one in a gastric carcinoma). Of note, three JAK1 mutations were an identical p.V658F mutation, which is homologous to JAK2 p.V617F mutation. We also found two other JAK1 mutations that occurred at very close sites (p.T782M and p.L783F). We found three of the four leukemias with JAK1 mutations expressed mutated JAK1 at the mRNA level. For JAK3 mutations, one of them was JAK3 p.V715I that is homologous to the JAK1 p.L783F. These recurrent mutations in identical and homologous sites suggest a possibility that alterations of these amino acids might be important for tumor pathogenesis. With respect to the cancer types, T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) showed the highest incidence of the mutations (3 of 11; 27.3%). Conclusion: Our data indicate that both JAK1 and JAK3 mutations occur in common human cancers and that JAK1 mutation in T-ALL is a frequent event. The data suggest that some of the JAK1 and JAK3 mutations may to be functional and contributes to cancer development, especially to T-ALL development.",

    "Abstract": "Background: P53 protein plays important role in the maintenance of genome stability in mammalian cells; it acts in many processes including cell-cycle checkpoint, DNA repair, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Mutations of P53 have been reported as common mutations in solid tumours, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL, and have been implicated in drug resistance, aggression and poor prognosis. Chronic infection with hepatitis C, HCV, has been associated in some studies with increased risk of NHL. HCV is a widespread infection in the Egyptian population. Circulating free DNA (CFDNA) has been shown to be a good source of liver tissue-derived DNA in African and Asian patients with chronic liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC. Our previous results have shown TP53 mutations in 5% of CFDNA and 10% of tumours of HCC, with underlying HCV. Objective: Since previous studies have shown p53 mutations in the DNAs extracted from the NH lymphoid tumours, we have assessed the presence of p53 mutations from exons 5 to 9 in CFDNA in patients with NHL, from Alexandria, Egypt, where HCV is highly prevalent, in a first attempt case-control preliminary study. Methods: CFDNA was extracted from sera of 20 cases with NHL and 20 negative control individuals. The retrieved serum DNAs were screened for TP53 mutations from exons 5 to 9 using direct sequencing and a PCR-restriction digestion analysis (RFLP). Concentrations of CFDNA were measured using Fluorometric assay. Results: Concentrations of CFDNA were significantly higher among NHL patients compared to the negative control individuals indicating a very high release or turn-over of DNA from the tumour into the blood stream among NHL patients. Mutations of p53 determined in NHL cases (30%) were of Arg-176 (1/20: 5%), Phe-238 (1/20: 5%), Ser-249 (2/20; 10%), Lys-249 (1/20: 5%) and Phe-250 (1/20: 5%). No mutations were detected among controls. However, Arg-213 polymorphism was found in 2 cases of NHL (10%) and in 1 case of controls (5%). Conclusion: Our findings of higher DNA concentrations with some p53 mutations in CFDNA from patients with NHL that match the previous reported p53 mutations from tumour DNA may hold promises that CFDNA may serve as a convenient source of tumour-derived DNA to serve as a promising tool of a non-invasive, low-cost new strategy for earlier detection, diagnosis and follow up of the disease. A large-scale prospective study utilizing CFDNA and DNA from tumours of NHL patients will be required to validate this first trial of utilizing CFDNA from NHL patients.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To describe systematically the clinical characteristics and phenotype of HNPCC families and the prevalence of HNPCC in the general population of CRC patients in China. Methods: HNPCC kindreds and CRC patients were from two sources. One was that we consecutively investigated kindreds and patients by ourselves. And the other was the published Chinese and foreign literature related to Chinese HNPCC syndrome. There were 142 HNPCC families fulfilling AC I and/or AC II including 57 families with detailed data, and 3874 general primary CRC patients in all. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: In AC I families, the number of Lynch syndrome I and II families were 25 (47.2%) and 28 (52.8%) respectively. There were 215 patients (82.4%) with CRC, 67 patients (25.7%) with extracolonic cancer and 50 patients (19.2%) with multiple primary cancers. In all CRC patients, multiple primary CRC were in 41 patients (19.1%), and the first-CRC was right-sided colorectal cancer in 143 patients (66.5%) and rectal cancer in 44 patients (20.5%). 8.8% and 19.2% of the first cancer were CRC and extracolonic cancers. Among those patients whose first cancer was CRC, 66.8% and 19.9% were right-sided colorectal cancer and rectal cancer, respectively. The similar results were found in AC II families. Normal distribution was only found in the distribution of the age of diagnosis of the first cancer in both AC I families (coefficient of skewness: u = 0.81, 0.20<0.40<P<0.50; coefficient of kurtosis: u = 1.13, 0.20<P<0.40, alpha = 0.20) and AC II families (coefficient of skewness: u = 0.63, P>0.5>0.20; coefficient of kurtosis: u = 0.84, 0.20<0.40<P<0.50, alpha = 0.20), but not found in the distribution of the age of diagnosis of the first CRC. When patients with HNPCC-associated cancer suffered from the first malignant tumor in HNPCC families diagnosed by AC I and AC II, the mean age and median age were 45.1+/-12.7 years and 44.0 years, 45.2+/-12.7 years and 44.5 years, respectively. The median age of diagnosis of the first tumor of the patients in the later generation was younger than that in the previous generation. Many extracolonic cancers were found to be associated with HNPCC syndrome. Gastric cancer was the most frequent extracolonic cancer followed by endometrial cancer and hepatocarcinoma. In general population of CRC patients, the prevalence of HNPCC diagnosed by AC I and AC II were 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively. Conclusion: The clinical phenotype and prevalence of Chinese HNPCC syndrome are similar to those of Europeans and Americans. Gastric cancer is the most common extracolonic malignant tumor. The age of diagnosis of the first malignant tumor tends to be increasingly younger in patients with HNPCC-related tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Cabozantinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor whose targets include vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, MET, and the TAM family of kinases (TYRO3, AXL, MER). Cabozantinib is approved for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib, based on improved overall survival and progression-free survival relative to placebo in the phase III CELESTIAL study. During CELESTIAL, the most common adverse events (AEs) experienced by patients receiving cabozantinib included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, fatigue, gastrointestinal-related events, and hypertension. These AEs can significantly impact treatment tolerability and patient quality of life. However, AEs can be effectively managed with supportive care and dose modifications. During CELESTIAL, more than half of the patients receiving cabozantinib required a dose reduction, while the rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was low. Here, we review the safety profile of cabozantinib and provide guidance on the prevention and management of the more common AEs, based on current evidence from the literature as well as our clinical experience. We consider the specific challenges faced by clinicians in treating this patient population and discuss factors that may affect exposure and tolerability to cabozantinib.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY 3) is a consequence of heterozygous germline mutations in HNF1A, and a subtype of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is caused by biallelic somatic HNF1A mutations; rare HCA may be related to MODY 3. This study aimed to investigate the cosegregation of HNF1A mutations with diabetes and HCA in two families. Methods: Two patients suffering from HCA and diabetes were screened for HNF1A germline and somatic mutations using direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) assay. Further, we screened eight relatives in the two independent families for diabetes, HCA and HNF1A variants. Additionally, we reviewed the literature concerning the phenotypes of MODY 3 and HCA at the background of HNF1A mutations. Results: Here we reported two families (a total of six relatives) with two missense germline mutations of HNF1A identified initially using direct sequence analysis (c.686G>A in family A and c.526 + 1G>A in family B). Somatic deletion of the second allele of HNF1A was found in liver tumor tissues in both probands who were diagnosed with HCA. There are a total of ten cases of both MODY 3 and HCA phenotypes reported in the literature to date; incomplete penetrance for HCA was observed, and all the patients with HCA developed diabetes. The onset of diabetes and HCA was highly variable, the treatment of diabetes varied from diet to insulin, and the clinical expression of HCA ranged from silent to hemorrhage. Further, the severity of diabetes mellitus was not related to the occurrence of HCA. Conclusions: This study describes the association of HCA and MODY 3 at the background of HNF1A mutations and highlights the importance of screening for HCA in MODY 3 families to avoid the possibility of severe complications. Further, the current study indicated that there may be a special mutational spectrum of HNF1A correlated with HCA in MODY 3 families.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the primary cause of hepatitis with chronic HBV infection, which may develop into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Detection of early-stage fibrosis related to HBV infection is of great clinical significance to block the progression of liver lesion. Direct liver biopsy is regarded as the gold standard to detect and assess fibrosis; however, this method is invasive and prone to clinical sampling error. In order to address these issues, we attempted to find more convenient and effective serum markers for detecting HBV-induced early-stage liver fibrosis. Aim: To investigate serum N-glycan profiling related to HBV-induced liver fibrosis and verify multiparameter diagnostic models related to serum N-glycan changes. Methods: N-glycan profiles from the sera of 432 HBV-infected patients with liver fibrosis were analyzed. Significant changed N-glycan levels (peaks) (P < 0.05) in different fibrosis stages were selected in the modeling group, and multiparameter diagnostic models were established based on changed N-glycan levels by logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate diagnostic efficacy of N-glycans models. These models were then compared with the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) , fibrosis index based on the four factors (FIB-4), glutamyltranspeptidase platelet albumin index (S index), GlycoCirrho-test, and GlycoFibro-test. Furthermore, we combined multiparameter diagnostic models with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and platelet (PLT) tests and compared their diagnostic power. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of N-glycan models was also verified in the validation group of patients. Results: Multiparameter diagnostic models constructed based on N-glycan peak 1, 3, 4 and 8 could distinguish between different stages of liver fibrosis. The area under ROC curves (AUROCs) of Model A and Model B were 0.890 and 0.752, respectively differentiating fibrosis F0-F1 from F2-F4, and F0-F2 from F3-F4, and surpassing other serum panels. However, AUROC (0.747) in Model C used for the diagnosis of F4 from F0-F3 was lower than AUROC (0.795) in FIB-4. In combination with ALT and PLT, the multiparameter models showed better diagnostic power (AUROC = 0.912, 0.829, 0.885, respectively) when compared with other models. In the validation group, the AUROCs of the three combined models (0.929, 0.858, and 0.867, respectively) were still satisfactory. We also applied the combined models to distinguish adjacent fibrosis stages of 432 patients (F0-F1/F2/F3/F4), and the AUROCs were 0.917, 0.720 and 0.785. Conclusion: Multiparameter models based on serum N-glycans are effective supplementary markers to distinguish between adjacent fibrosis stages of patients caused by HBV, especially in combination with ALT and PLT.",

Materials and methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database with published date from the earliest to February 29th, 2016. No language restrictions were applied, but only prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs were eligible for a full-text review. The primary outcome was the overall survival (OS) and effective rate (the rate of partial atrophy or complete clearance of the tumor lesion). The odds ratios (ORs) were combined using either the fixed-effects model or random-effects model. Results: Eight trials (3 RCTs and 5 non-RCTs) were included, involving a total of 1121 patients. Patients receiving combined therapy of TACE plus 131I-labelled metuximab showed significant improvement in effective rate {OR = 4.00, (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.40-6.66), p < 0.001}, 1-year OS (OR = 2.03 [95% CI: 1.55-2.67], p < 0.001) and 2-year OS (OR = 2.57 [95% CI: 1.41-4.66], p = 0.002]. Conclusion: TACE plus 131I-labelled metuximab is more beneficial for treating advanced HCCs than TACE alone in terms of tumor response and OS.

    "Abstract": "Control of cell growth and differentiation occurs via extracellular signals known as growth factors. Growth factors are high affinity ligands for transmembrane receptors belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). A number of genetic evidences have implicated RTKs in human diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. For instance, germline missense mutations involving the Ret receptor are found in patients affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B) or familial medullary thyroid carcinomas. Somatic mutations in the Kit receptor are found in mastocytomas and in gastrointestinal tumors. Germline and sporadic mutations of the Met receptor have been described in kidney and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of the HER-2/neu receptor in breast cancer has been associated with tumor progression. The enzymatic activity of RTKs is strictly regulated and is usually inhibited under basal conditions. Receptor activation triggers a biochemical signalling cascade inside the cytoplasm, named signal transduction, which is subverted during the malignant transformation of cells. Signal transduction by RTKs is a multistep process which includes: (i) Ligand binding and receptor dimerization, (ii) receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine residues; (iii) recruitment to the receptor and activation of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that transmit signals to the nucleus. Each of the steps involved in this process can potentially be targeted to block the aberrant properties of tyrosine kinase receptors. By using the MET oncogene as a model this review focuses on the strategies that can be applied to therapeutically target RTKs.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Autoimmune hepatitis can cause liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its treatment option include the use of steroids and/or immune-suppressive agents such as azathioprine. However, these drugs have some side effects. Thus, close follow-up is needed during treatment. Here, we present an extremely rare case of a patient with an autoimmune hepatitis who died from necrotizing gastritis during immunosuppressive treatment. Case summary: A 52-year-old female patient was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis. We treated this patient with immunosuppressive agents. High-dose steroid treatment was initially started. Then azathioprine treatment was added while steroid was tapering. Five weeks after the start of treatment, she visited the emergency room due to generalized abdominal pain and vomiting. After computed tomography scan, the patient was diagnosed with necrotizing gastritis and the patient progressed to septic shock. Treatment for sepsis was continued in the intensive care unit. However, the patient died at 6 h after admission to the emergency room. Conclusion: In patients with autoimmune infections undergoing immunosuppressant therapy, rare complications such as necrotizing gastritis may occur, thus requiring clinical attention.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Liver transplantation (LT) offers the most effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Various preoperative variables are correlated with survival after LT, but the prognostic role of aging on LT remains controversial. Methods: Between January 2001 and December 2011, 290 consecutive transplants for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma performed in Shanghai First People's Hospital (People's Republic of China) were analyzed retrospectively. We compared patient characteristics and survival curves between a younger group (less than 49 years, n=135) and an aged group (50 years or older, n=155). We then performed Cox multivariate regression analysis of the risk factors for survival in aged and younger patients. Results: Younger age was associated with higher alpha-fetoprotein (P=0.014), larger tumor size (P=0.038), poorer differentiation (P=0.025), portal lymph node metastasis (P=0.001), and higher recurrence rate (P=0.038). Aged patients had significantly longer recurrence-free survival and overall survival (P=0.020 and P=0.014, respectively); however, there were no significant differences between the younger and aged patients who met the Milan criteria (P>0.05). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 59.7%, 44.5%, and 37.3%, respectively, in the younger group, and 67.9%, 55.3%, and 53.8%, respectively, in the aged group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 68.4%, 45.5%, and 38.9%, respectively, in the younger group, and 76.1%, 59.7%, and 53.9%, respectively, in the aged group. Alpha-fetoprotein ≥400 ng/mL, microvascular invasion, and tumor size >5 cm were independent risk factors for prognosis in both groups. Conclusion: Younger patients in our center tended to present with more aggressive tumors and have a higher risk of recurrence. Our single-center experience suggests that younger patients should be assessed more rigorously before LT, while aged patients should be actively considered for LT after appropriate selection.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Genus Ficus (Moraceae) constitutes more than 850 species and about 2000 varieties and it acts as a golden mine that could afford effective and safe remedies combating many health disorders. Objectives: Discrimination of Ficus cordata, Ficus ingens, and Ficus palmata using chemometric analysis and assessment of their role in combating oxidative stress. Materials and methods: Phytochemical profiling of the methanol extracts of the three Ficus species and their successive fractions was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Their discrimination was carried out using the obtained spectral data applying chemometric unsupervised pattern-recognition techniques, namely, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. In vitro hepatoprotective and antioxidant evaluation of the samples was performed using human hepatocellular carcinoma cells challenged by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Results: Altogether, 22 compounds belonging to polyphenolics, flavonoids, and furanocoumarins were identified in the three Ficus species. Aviprin is the most abundant compound in F. cordata while chlorogenic acid and psoralen were present in high percentages in F. ingens and F. palmata, respectively. Chemometric analyses showed that F. palmata and F. cordata are more closely related chemically to each other rather than F. ingens. The ethyl acetate fractions of all the examined species showed a marked hepatoprotective efficacy accounting for 54.78%, 55.46%, and 56.42% reduction in serum level of alanine transaminase and 56.82%, 54.16%, and 57.06% suppression in serum level of aspartate transaminase, respectively, at 100 μg/mL comparable to CCl4-treated cells. Conclusion: Ficus species exhibited a no table antioxidant and hepatoprotective activity owing to their richness in polyphenolics and furanocoumarins. Summary: Ficus cordata, Ficus ingens, and Ficus palmata were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry that revealed their richness with polyphenolics and furanocoumarinsDiscrimination of the three species was performed using spectral data coupled with chemometrics that showed that F. palmata and F. cordata are chemically related to each other rather than F. ingensIn vitro hepatoprotective and antioxidant evaluation was performed using human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The ethyl acetate fractions of all the examined species showed a marked hepatoprotective efficacyFicus species exhibited notable activities due to polyphenolics and furanocoumarins.

    "Abstract": "Background: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal-dominant hereditary disorder associated with the development of endocrine tumors due to reduced expression of the tumor suppressor protein menin. Recent studies indicate a general role of menin in carcinogenesis, affecting the prevalence and clinical course of common non-endocrine tumors such as breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma. Here we report a new germline missense mutation of Men1 in a German family with atypical tumor phenotype over three generations. Based on the type of mutation, we discuss possible changes in menin function leading to atypical tumorigenesis and present the clinical significance of such findings. Case presentation: A German family with a history of primary hyperparathyroidism presented to our Hospital for further evaluation. Members of the family demonstrated many different atypical tumors, such as renal cell carcinoma, papillary thyroid cancer and prostate cancer. DNA sequencing from peripheral blood revealed a novel mutation: Ser38Cys [TCC>TGC] in exon 2, codon 38 of Men1. This novel mutation is located in a region of menin which is responsible for interactions with the transcription factor JunD. This factor has recently been associated with prostate cancer. DNA sequencing of two of the atypical tumors (prostate cancer, papillary thyroid cancer) did not reveal a loss of heterozygosity, indicating an impact on menin expression and function in the heterozygous state, in line with results in +/-Men1 mutant mice developing prostate cancer. Conclusion: The results and clinical course of disease in this case indicate the potential role of menin in the development of non-endocrine or atypical-endocrine tumors in MEN1 patients. Further investigations are needed to clarify both the general role of menin and the importance of specific mutations in carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, in families with uncommon manifestations of the syndrome early diagnostic adjustments should be considered.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Compared the outcomes between lenvatinib plus camrelizumab therapy and lenvatinib monotherapy as post-progression treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with progressive disease (PD). Patients and methods: A total of 48 advanced HCC patients were included in this retrospective study between June 2019 and March 2020. The patients were divided into the lenvatinib plus camrelizumab group (n=21) and the lenvatinib group (n=27). Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events (AEs). Results: The median follow-up time was 8.4 months. The median OS was not obtained. The median PFS of lenvatinib plus camrelizumab group was significantly longer than that of lenvatinib group (8.0 months vs 4.0 months, p=0.011). Compared with lenvatinib group, lenvatinib plus camrelizumab group had higher ORR (28.57% vs 7.41%) and disease control rate (DCR) (71.43% vs 51.85%). The most common adverse events (AEs) included hand-foot skin reaction, hypertensions and abnormal hepatic function damage. Overall, 23.81% and 25.93% of patients experienced grade ≥3AEs in the lenvatinib plus camrelizumab group and the lenvatinib group, respectively. Conclusion: Lenvatinib plus camrelizumab as post-progression treatment is effective and safe for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with PD.",

    "Abstract": "Alcohol is a leading cause of liver disease and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several factors, including the amount and duration of alcohol consumption, affect the development and progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). ALD represents a spectrum of liver pathology ranging from fatty change to fibrosis to cirrhosis. Early diagnosis of ALD is important to encourage alcohol abstinence, minimize the progression of liver fibrosis, and manage cirrhosis-related complications including hepatocellular carcinoma. A number of questionnaires and laboratory tests are available to screen for alcohol intake. Liver biopsy remains the gold-standard diagnostic tool for ALD, but noninvasive accurate alternatives, including a number of biochemical tests as well as liver stiffness measurement, are increasingly being utilized in the evaluation of patients with suspected ALD. The management of ALD depends largely on complete abstinence from alcohol. Supportive care should focus on treating alcohol withdrawal and providing enteral nutrition while managing the complications of liver failure. Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a devastating acute form of ALD that requires early recognition and specialized tertiary medical care. Assessment of AH severity using defined scoring systems is important to allocate resources and initiate appropriate therapy. Corticosteroids or pentoxifylline are commonly used in treating AH but provide a limited survival benefit. Liver transplantation represents the ultimate therapy for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, with most transplant centers mandating a 6 month period of abstinence from alcohol before listing. Early liver transplantation is also emerging as a therapeutic measure in specifically selected patients with severe AH. A number of novel targeted therapies for ALD are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.",

Aims: This study aims to identify the gene expression signature of iHCC compared with single nodular (SN)-type HCC according to the gross classification. Methods: The whole-exome sequencing was performed in six matched HCC tumor/normal pairs (three infiltrative type and three single nodular type) from six patients who received curative hepatectomy. Subsequent validation using Sanger sequencing and real-time PCR was performed in 30 HCC tumor samples (15 infiltrative type and 15 single nodular type). Results: Following whole-exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis, it revealed significant difference of iHCC from SN-type HCC in gene patterns. Particularly, a typical growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR3 was predominantly mutated in iHCC. One nonsynonymous variant c.G285T (p.Q95H) and five additional mutations (c.G938A:p.G313D, c.G1291A:p.A431T, c.C1355G:p.T452R, c.C1377T:p.L459L, and c.A1445T:p.E482V) were investigated by whole-exome and Sanger sequencing, respectively. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the specific expression of FGFR3 in iHCC samples. Conclusion: Our studies indicated that FGFR3 may be a candidate oncogene in tumor progression and a promising therapeutic target in iHCC patients who had early recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Our study aimed to investigate the effect of anti-differentiation noncoding RNA (ANCR) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its potential molecular mechanisms. Methods: The expression of ANCR was detected by qRT-RCR in both HCC tissues and HCC cells. Moreover, the relationship between ANCR expression and clinical parameters in HCC patients was investigated. The proliferation, cell clones, migration, invasion and apoptosis of MHCC97H and HCCLM3 cells were measured by MTT assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expressions of N-cadherin, vimentin, E-cadherin, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, Wnt1, β-catenin and GSK-3β in MHCC97H and HCCLM3 cells were measured by Western blot. Results: Our results showed that ANCR was lowly expressed in both HCC tissues and HCC cells. ANCR expression was closely associated with tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages and vascular invasion in HCC. ANCR could dramatically inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as promote apoptosis in MHCC97H and HCCLM3 cells. ANCR could significantly increase the expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, E-cadherin and GSK-3β but reduce the expression of Bcl-2, N-cadherin, vimentin, Wnt1 and β-catenin in MHCC97H and HCCLM3 cells. In addition, Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor (IWP-2) partially reversed the effects of silencing ANCR on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of HCCLM3 cells. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that ANCR can suppress cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as promote apoptosis of HCC cells via modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Congenital dilatation of the bile-duct (CDD) is a rare, mostly sporadic, disorder that results in bile retention with severe associated complications. CDD affects mainly Asians. To our knowledge, no genetic study has ever been conducted. Methods: We aim to identify genetic risk factors by a \"trio-based\" exome-sequencing approach, whereby 31 CDD probands and their unaffected parents were exome-sequenced. Seven-hundred controls from the local population were used to detect gene-sets significantly enriched with rare variants in CDD patients. Results: Twenty-one predicted damaging de novo variants (DNVs; 4 protein truncating and 17 missense) were identified in several evolutionarily constrained genes (p < 0.01). Six genes carrying DNVs were associated with human developmental disorders involving epithelial, connective or bone morphologies (PXDN, RTEL1, ANKRD11, MAP2K1, CYLD, ACAN) and four linked with cholangio- and hepatocellular carcinomas (PIK3CA, TLN1 CYLD, MAP2K1). Importantly, CDD patients have an excess of DNVs in cancer-related genes (p < 0.025). Thirteen genes were recurrently mutated at different sites, forming compound heterozygotes or functionally related complexes within patients. Conclusions: Our data supports a strong genetic basis for CDD and show that CDD is not only genetically heterogeneous but also non-monogenic, requiring mutations in more than one genes for the disease to develop. The data is consistent with the rarity and sporadic presentation of CDD.",

We report three members of one family with a novel germline in-frame deletion of HNF1A exons 2-3 identified initially using array CGH and direct sequence analysis. All three family members have MODY3 in association with primary liver cell tumours (HCA, liver adenomatosis (LA), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)). Additionally, a high rate of infant mortality was observed in the family. The described family demonstrates a novel HNF1A mutation associated with both benign and malignant primary liver cell tumours and MODY3.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The mean survival is less than 6 months in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with extrahepatic metastasis. Gastrointestinal(GI) bleeding frequency due to HCC invasion is 0.05% to 2.0%, and may be fatal. Case presentation: We encountered a case of HCC with direct invasion to the gastrium that caused a life-threatening upper GI bleeding. Our patient was a 62 year old male who was a heavy smoker and drinker for almost 30 years. He had several upper GI bleeding episodes during the previous 6 months. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 13cm liver tumour directly invading the gastrium. Partial hepatic resection and subtotal gastrectomy were performed. Unfortunately, the patient died at the intensive care unit postoperatively due to hepatic failure. Discussion: Although the prognosis of HCC that has invaded the gastrium is very poor due to the advanced stage of the disease, surgical resection may be a favourable treatment option for patients with a massive upper GI bleeding. Conclusions: The incidence of patients with massive bleeding due to gastric invasion of HCC is low, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. Our purpose while presenting this rare case is to increase the awareness about the issue.",

The 18F-FPA uptake mechanism was investigated using inhibition experiments with orlistat and 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid. The 18F-FPA PET imaging was performed in different tumor animal models and compared with 18F-FDG. We also evaluated the expressions of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) in these cell lines. Results: In vitro experiments showed that the radiotracer uptake patterns were complementary in the HCC cell lines. Orlistat and 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid decreased the uptake of 18F-FPA. The tumor-to-liver ratio of 18F-FPA was superior to that of 18F-FDG in the SK-Hep1 and HepG2 tumors ( P < .05). However, in the Hep3B tumors, the tumor-to-liver normalized uptake of 18F-FDG was higher than 18F-FPA ( P < .01). FASN was highly expressed in cell lines with high 18F-FPA uptake, whereas GLUT1 was highly expressed in cell lines with high 18F-FDG uptake. The 18F-FPA uptake correlated with FASN ( r = 0.89, P = .014) and MMP2 ( r = 0.77, P = .002) expressions. Conclusions: PET imaging with 18F-FPA combined with 18F-FDG can be an alternative for detecting HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Tolvaptan (TVP) is an effective treatment for patients with cirrhotic ascites; however, studies have indicated that a sufficient effect is difficult to obtain in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluates the efficacy of TVP in patients with HCC with refractory ascites. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 32 patients with liver cirrhosis and refractory ascites [mean age: 74 years (range, 47-86 years), men: 78.1% (25/32)]. All patients had HCC and were treated with TVP at our hospital. A TVP responder was defined as a patient who experienced decrease in body weight by ≥1.5 kg within 1 week of treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate clinical and laboratory predictive factors of TVP response. Results: The TVP response rate was 46.9% (15/32 patients) after 1 week of treatment. HCC treatment (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and/or radiofrequency ablation) was administered to 11/15 (73.3%) responders. In the multivariate analysis, the reduction of urine osmolality was higher in responders than nonresponders (202 mOsm/l vs. 65 mOsm/l, P = 0.040), and the tumor stage (P = 0.043) was worse in nonresponders. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated a significantly better prognosis among responders than among nonresponders (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The HCC tumor stage and the reduction in urine osmolality can predict the efficacy of TVP in patients with refractory ascites complicated with HCC. TVP may allow therapeutic intervention for HCC and improve prognosis, even in patients with Child-Pugh class C.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective in treating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. The real-world treatment outcome in Taiwanese patients on a nationwide basis is elusive. Methods: The Taiwan HCV Registry (TACR) programme is a nationwide registry platform including 48 study sites, which is organized and supervised by the Taiwan Association for the Study of the Liver. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response (SVR12, undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after end-of-treatment). Results: A total of 13 951 registered patients with SVR12 data available were analysed (mean age, 63.0 years; female, 55.9%; HCV genotype-1 [GT1], 57.9%; cirrhosis, 38.4%; preexisting hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], 10.6%; and hepatitis B virus coinfection, 7.7%). The overall SVR12 rate was 98.3%, with 98.7%, 98.0%, 98.4% and 97.4% in treatment-naïve noncirrhotic, treatment-naïve cirrhotic, treatment-experienced noncirrhotic and treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients, respectively. The SVR12 rate was > 95% across all subgroups except treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients who received sofosbuvir/ribavirin (88.7%), treatment-naïve noncirrhotic patients (94.8%) and treatment-experienced cirrhotic (94.8%) patients who received daclatasvir/asunaprevir. The most important factor associated with treatment failure was DAA adherence < 60% ( adjusted odds ratio [aOR]/95% confidence interval [CI]: 117.1/52.4-261.3, P < .001), followed by GT3/GT2 (aOR/CI: 5.78/2.25-14.9, P = .0003 and aOR/CI: 1.55/1.05-2.29, P = .03, compared with GT1), active hepatocellular carcinoma (aOR/CI: 4.29/2.57-7.16, P < .001), the use of sofosbuvir/ribavirin (aOR/CI: 2.51/1.67-3.77, P < .001) and daclatasvir/asunaprevir (aOR/CI: 3.29/1.94-5.58, P < .001), decompensated liver cirrhosis (aOR/CI: 2.50/1.20-5.22, P = .02) and high HCV viral loads (aOR/CI: 2.16/1.57-2.97, P < .001). Conclusions: DAAs are highly effective in treating Taiwanese HCV patients in the real-world setting. Maintaining DAA adherence and selecting highly efficacious regimens are keys to ensure treatment success.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prediction models can inform clinical decisions about HCC screening provided their predictions are robust. We conducted an external validation of 6 HCC prediction models for UK patients with cirrhosis and a HCV virological cure. Methods: Patients with cirrhosis and cured HCV were identified from the Scotland HCV clinical database (N = 2,139) and the STratified medicine to Optimise Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (STOP-HCV) study (N = 606). We calculated patient values for 4 competing non-genetic HCC prediction models, plus 2 genetic models (for the STOP-HCV cohort only). Follow-up began at the date of sustained virological response (SVR) achievement. HCC diagnoses were identified through linkage to nation-wide cancer, hospitalisation, and mortality registries. We compared discrimination and calibration measures between prediction models. Results: Mean follow-up was 3.4-3.9 years, with 118 (Scotland) and 40 (STOP-HCV) incident HCCs observed. The age-male sex-ALBI-platelet count score (aMAP) model showed the best discrimination; for example, the Concordance index (C-index) in the Scottish cohort was 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.81). However, for all models, discrimination varied by cohort (being better for the Scottish cohort) and by age (being better for younger patients). In addition, genetic models performed better in patients with HCV genotype 3. The observed 3-year HCC risk was 3.3% (95% CI 2.6-4.2) and 5.1% (3.5-7.0%) in the Scottish and STOP-HCV cohorts, respectively. These were most closely matched by aMAP, in which the mean predicted 3-year risk was 3.6% and 5.0% in the Scottish and STOP-HCV cohorts, respectively. Conclusions: aMAP was the best-performing model in terms of both discrimination and calibration and, therefore, should be used as a benchmark for rival models to surpass. This study underlines the opportunity for 'real-world' risk stratification in patients with cirrhosis and cured HCV. However, auxiliary research is needed to help translate an HCC risk prediction into an HCC-screening decision. Lay summary: Patients with cirrhosis and cured HCV are at high risk of developing liver cancer, although the risk varies substantially from one patient to the next. Risk calculator tools can alert clinicians to patients at high risk and thereby influence decision-making. In this study, we tested the performance of 6 risk calculators in more than 2,500 patients with cirrhosis and cured HCV. We show that some risk calculators are considerably better than others. Overall, we found that the 'aMAP' calculator worked the best, but more work is needed to convert predictions into clinical decisions.",

    "Abstract": "We aimed to analyze the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the 5' regulatory region of the human organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) gene with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A case-control study including age- and sex-matched groups of normal subjects and patients with CKD (n = 162 each) was designed. Direct sequencing of the 5' regulatory region (+88 to -1196 region) showed that patients with CKD had a higher frequency of the -475 SNP (T > T/G) than normal subjects (14/162 vs. 2/162). The luciferase activity assay results indicated that the -475G SNP had a higher promoter efficiency than the -475T SNP. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and LC/MS/MS analyses showed that the -475G SNP up-regulated 26 proteins and down-regulated 74 proteins. The Southwestern blot assay results revealed that the -475G SNP decreased the binding of Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF), a transcription repressor, compared to the -475T SNP. Overexpression of HDGF significantly down-regulated OAT1 in renal tubular cells. Moreover, a zebrafish animal model showed that HDGF-knockdown zebrafish embryos had higher rates of kidney malformation than wild-type controls [18/78 (23.1%) vs. 1/30 (3.3%)]. In conclusion, our results suggest that an OAT1 SNP might be clinically associated with CKD. Renal tubular cells with the -475 SNP had increased OAT1 expression, which resulted in increased transportation of organic anion toxins into cells. Cellular accumulation of organic anion toxins caused cytotoxicity and resulted in CKD.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: In this study, we investigated whether cytochrome P450s (CYPs) induced by a typical chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide chlordane (CLD) potentiate hepatic toxicity of carbon disulfide (CS2). Materials and methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with CLD (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) daily for 4 days, and 24 h after the final injection the rats were treated with CS2 (380 mg/kg, i.p.) in corn oil; while controls received the vehicle alone. The rats were then sacrificed at 3, 6, and 24 h following the CS2 treatment. Results: It was found that at 3 h post-treatment, total hepatic glutathione (GSH) decreased modestly, but lipid peroxidation increased markedly, while all CLD-inducible CYPs (1A1, 2B1, 2E1, and 3A2) were inhibited by CS2 variably but significantly. On the other hand, samples taken at 24 h following the CS2 treatment showed a significant increase in relative liver weights, hepatic GSH and lipid peroxidation, microsomal reactive oxygen species (ROS), and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) level. Activity of the CYPs was also increased, but remained significantly depressed, especially that of CYP2B1. Livers removed at 3 and 6 h after CS2 treatment showed subtle to distinct apoptotic changes, while a severe lesion of hydropic degeneration of the centrilobular cells with apoptosis was microscopically distinguishable in samples taken at 24 h. Conclusions: These results suggest that the metabolism of CS2 by CLD-induced CYPs and the generation of lipid peroxides may have in concert contributed to the distinct hepatocellular damage.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one the most common malignancies and has poor prognosis in patients. The aim of the present study is to explore the clinical significance of the main genes involved in the Janus kinase (JAK)‑signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in HCC. GSE14520, a training cohort containing 212 hepatitis B virus‑infected HCC patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas as a validation cohort containing 370 HCC patients, were used to analyze the diagnostic and prognostic significance for HCC. Joint‑effect analyses were performed to determine diagnostic and prognostic significance. Nomograms and risk score models were constructed to predict HCC prognosis using the two cohorts. Additionally, molecular mechanism analysis was performed for the two cohorts. Prognosis‑associated genes in the two cohorts were further validated for differential expression using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction of 21 pairs of hepatitis B virus‑infected HCC samples. JAK2, TYK2, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5B had diagnostic significance in the two cohorts (all area under curves >0.5; P≤0.05). In addition, JAK2, STAT5A, STAT6 exhibited prognostic significance in both cohorts (all adjusted P≤0.05). Furthermore, joint‑effect analysis had advantages over using one gene alone. Molecular mechanism analyses confirmed that STAT6 was enriched in pathways and terms associated with the cell cycle, cell division and lipid metabolism. Nomograms and risk score models had advantages for HCC prognosis prediction. When validated in 21 pairs of HCC and non‑tumor tissue, STAT6 was differentially expressed, whereas JAK2 was not differentially expressed. In conclusion, JAK2, STAT5A and STAT6 may be potential prognostic biomarkers for HCC. JAK2, TYK2, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5B may be potential diagnostic biomarkers for HCC. STAT6 has a role in HCC that may be mediated via effects on the cell cycle, cell division and lipid metabolism.",

    "Abstract": "Characterization of the rat PRL receptor (PRLR) gene has revealed three separate untranslated exon 1 sequences, each associated with a different transcription start site and 5'-flanking sequence. We show by RT-PCR that exon 1A is expressed primarily in liver but is also detectable in ovary and mammary gland. Exon 1B expression is observed exclusively in the ovary, whereas exon 1C is expressed in all three tissues. Transient transfection of luciferase reporter constructs containing parts of the 5'-flanking regions (0.3-1.1 kb) of exon 1A, 1B, and 1C, respectively, showed activity of the 1A promoter in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, and the rat hepatoma cell line, H4II, which was 10- to 14-fold increased compared with the activity of the promoter-less luciferase vector. No activity of the 1A promoter was detected in the human mammary cell line, T-47D. Relative to a vector containing the Simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter, the 1A promoter had 20% activity in H4II cells and 1-3% activity in CHO and HepG2 cells. The 1B promoter produced a 6.1-fold increase of luciferase activity in CHO cells (approximately 2% of the SV40 promoter), whereas no significant activity was detected in HepG2, H4II, and T-47D cells. The 1C promoter was strongly active in T-47D cells (approximately 64-fold over control) and moderately active in the other cell lines tested (9- to 13-fold over control). 5'-Deletion analysis of the 1A promoter revealed that a fragment containing -83/ +81 bp, relative to the transcription start site, was sufficient to drive transcription in hepatoma cells, whereas this construct was inactive in CHO cells. Cotransfection of CHO cells with the -83/+81 construct and an expression vector encoding the liver-enriched transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), revealed a dose-dependent transactivation of the proximal 1A promoter with a maximal stimulation of approximately 10-fold. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed binding of HNF4 to the sequence -14/+24 of the 1A promoter, and mutational analysis revealed that the sequence GGGCAAAGTCA at position +11/+21 is required for this binding. We conclude that the 1A, 1B, and 1C promoters of the PRLR gene are used in a cell type- dependent way that may play a role in differential hormonal regulation of the gene. In particular, we have shown that HNF4 operates on the proximal 1A promoter and may be responsible, in combination with other factors, for the increased activity of this promoter in adult female liver.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Recent studies demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2293152 in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and rs7574865 in signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) are associated with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related HCC in the Chinese population. We hypothesized that these polymorphisms might be related to HCC susceptibility in Thai population as well. Study subjects were divided into 3 groups consisting of CHB-related HCC (n=192), CHB without HCC (n=200) and healthy controls (n=190). The studied SNPs were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results showed that the distribution of different genotypes for both polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05). Our data demonstrated positive association of rs7574865 with HCC risk when compared to healthy controls under an additive model (GG versus TT: odds ratio (OR) =2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.06-4.03, P=0.033). This correlation remained significant under allelic and recessive models (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.09-1.96, P=0.012 and OR=1.71, 95% CI=1.13-2.59, P=0.011, respectively). However, no significant association between rs2293152 and HCC development was observed. These data suggest that SNP rs7574865 in STAT4 might contribute to progression to HCC in the Thai population.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and K-ras occur in the majority of human colorectal cancers. Loss of functional APC protein activates the Wnt signal transduction pathway, allowing the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, which then binds to T-cell factor-4 (Tcf-4), causing increased transcriptional activation of downstream target genes. We investigated the hypothesis that the activation of the WNT pathway regulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 was down-regulated after the induction of full-length APC in the HT29-APC cell line. We identified a Tcf-4-binding element (TBE) in the COX-2 promoter that specifically bound to Tcf-4 in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. COX-2 promoter luciferase activity is down-regulated by APC in a promoter reporter construct containing the, TBE but not with mutant TBE. Mutant beta-catenin expression up-regulated the COX-2 promoter activity and the endogenous COX-2 mRNA expression in HuH7, hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, which is partially abrogated by cotransfection with a dominant-negative Tcf-4 expression vector. Although beta-catenin alone did not increase COX-2 protein to detectable levels in HuH7 cells, coexpression of both mutant beta-catenin and mutant K-ras increased COX-2 protein expression, which is consistent with the previous reports that K-ras can stabilize COX-2 mRNA. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that COX-2 is down-regulated by APC and up-regulated by nuclear beta-catenin accumulation, and additionally implicate the Wnt signal transduction pathway in colon and liver carcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatoblastoma (HB), the most common hepatic neoplasm in children is associated with germline mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli tumor-suppressor gene that cause familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis have a 750 to 7500× the risk of developing HB. We report 3 children with APC gene mutation, who underwent resection or liver transplant for HB. In addition to HB, all 3 patients had multiple independent adenoma-like nodules lacking qualities of intrahepatic metastases. Twenty-five nodules were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using a panel of antibodies including glypican-3 (GPC3), β-catenin, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, CD34, Ki-67, glutamine synthetase (GS), and fatty acid binding protein. The nodules were round, ranged in size from 0.2 to 1.5 cm, and paler than the background liver. All lacked the chemotherapy effect. The nodules were circumscribed but nonencapsulated and composed of well-differentiated hepatocytes with occasional minor atypical features and absent or rare portal tracts. One lesion displayed a \"nodule-within-nodule\" pattern. The nodules demonstrated diffuse GS overexpression. Nine (36%) nodules were focally reactive for GPC3, and 1 (4%) displayed focal nuclear β-catenin expression. The associated HB showed diffuse expression of GS, GPC3, and β-catenin nuclear staining. We interpret these nodules as neoplastic with most being adenomas (GPC3 negative) that show features of independent origin and represent early stages of carcinogenesis, implying potential to progress to HB or hepatocellular carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report of multifocal neoplasms in patients with HB and APC gene mutation.",

We examined the promoter activity of the 5'-flanking region of each of these alleles by transient transfection luciferase assay. DNASE2*H had 5-fold higher promoter activity than DNASE2*L in human hepatoma HepG2 cell. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the proximal promoter regions revealed a G to A transition at position -75; G and A residues were assigned to DNASE2*H and *L, respectively. Since no differences were found between the open reading frame sequences of these alleles, it is likely that the A-75G transition causes the allelic difference in the promoter activity of the gene, underlying the genetic polymorphism.",

    "Abstract": "STAT4 signal pathway plays an important role in IFN-γ-mediated antiviral activity. Recent studies show an association of STAT4 polymorphisms with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We therefore investigated the influence of STAT4 polymorphisms on the susceptibility of spontaneous clearance of HBV in a Chinese Han population. Genomic DNA from 288 cases with chronic HBV infection and 288 controls who spontaneously recovered from HBV infection was analyzed for five SNPs in the STAT4 gene (rs7574865, rs7572482, rs7582694 rs11889341, and rs8179673).Our analysis revealed that all the minor alleles of the four SNPs (rs7574865, rs7582694, rs11889341, and rs8179673) had an association with overall decreased risk to HBV infection [p = 0.040, OR 0.762 (95 % CI 0.593-0.981); p = 0.011, OR 0.686 (95 % CI 0.535-0.878); p = 0.023, OR 0.751 (95 % CI 0.586-0.962); p = 0.002, OR 0.670 (95 % CI 0.521-0.861), respectively]. The major alleles of the four SNPs were found to be associated with increased risk of HBV-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, the haplotype GGGCT constructed from the five SNPs was found to have a highly significant association with chronic HBV infection when compared to the controls who spontaneously recovered from HBV infection [p = 0.031, OR 1.368 (95 % CI 1.028-1.818)]. These findings indicate that STAT4 minor allele may be associated with the spontaneous clearance of HBV, whereas the major allele may be associated with the progress of the HBV-related liver disease.",

    "Abstract": "Aim of the study: Hepatotropic viruses cause metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis. Moreover, metabolic factors, such as insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, increase the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis. Cytokines secreted by the adipose tissue (adipokines) may be implicated in these metabolic disturbances, but there is little evidence regarding the role of adipokines in virus-related cirrhosis and HCC. Thus, we studied whether serum concentrations of selected adipokines were altered in patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis, including patients with HCC. Material and methods: We included 43 patients with liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C. Of these patients, 36 had HCC and 7 did not have any malignant lesions. In addition to routine clinical and laboratory variables, we analyzed serum concentrations of betatrophin, insulin, vaspin, visfatin, and irisin. Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients with HCC had significantly increased vaspin concentrations and significantly reduced irisin concentrations. Compared with controls, patients with virus-related cirrhosis, with or without HCC, had significantly increased concentrations of insulin and betatrophin. The serum visfatin concentration was non-significantly higher in patients with virus-related cirrhosis than in controls. None of the studied adipokines was a significant predictor of HCC. Serum concentrations of the studied adipokines were not related to cirrhosis severity or HCC stage. Conclusions: Metabolic parameters, including serum adipokine concentrations, are altered in patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis. Adipokines might be related to the HCC risk in these patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Reliable non-invasive markers to characterize inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are lacking. We investigated the relationship between plasma cytokine levels and features of NAFLD histology to gain insight into cellular pathways driving NASH and to identify potential non-invasive discriminators of NAFLD severity and pattern. Methods: Cytokines were measured from plasma obtained at enrollment in pediatric participants in NASH Clinical Research Network studies with liver biopsy-proven NAFLD. Cytokines were chosen a priori as possible discriminators of NASH and its components. Minimization of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to determine cytokines retained in multivariable models. Results: Of 235 subjects, 31% had \"Definite NASH\" on liver histology, 43% had \"Borderline NASH\", and 25% had NAFLD but not NASH. Total plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and activated PAI1 levels were higher in pediatric participants with Definite NASH and with lobular inflammation. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) was higher in those with stage 3-4 fibrosis and lobular inflammation. sIL-2rα was higher in children with stage 3-4 fibrosis and portal inflammation. In multivariable analysis, PAI1 variables were discriminators of Borderline/Definite NASH, definite NASH, lobular inflammation and ballooning. IL-8 increased with steatosis and fibrosis severity; sIL-2rα increased with fibrosis severity and portal inflammation. IL-7 decreased with portal inflammation and fibrosis severity. Conclusions: Plasma cytokines associated with histology varied considerably among NASH features, suggesting promising avenues for investigation. Future, more targeted analysis is needed to identify the role of these markers in NAFLD and to evaluate their potential as non-invasive discriminators of disease severity.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To compare the gastric cancer (GC) patients by their family history with gastric and non-GC. Methods: Positive family histories within second-degree relatives and clinicopathological features were obtained for 256 patients. Results: Of the 256 probands, 112 (76 male, 36 female) were incorporated into familial GC (FGC) group: at least two GC members; 144 (98 male, 46 female) were included in the non-FGC group (relatives only affected with non-GCs). Of 399 tumors in relatives (181 from FGC against 212 from non-FGC), GC was the most frequent, followed by esophageal, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancer. Nasopharyngeal cancer was next to lung cancer but prior to breast and urogenital cancers. Most affected members aggregated within first-degree relatives (FGC: 66 siblings, 48 fathers, 31 mothers, four offspring; non-FGC: 56 fathers, 55 siblings, 43 mothers, and 15 offspring). The ratio of males to females in affected first-degree relatives was usually higher in male probands. Paternal history of GC was a slight risk for GC in males (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.53-2.69), while risk of GC by maternal history of non-GCs was increased in females (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.22-0.97). Diffuse-GC was the major histological type in all subgroups. Difference in tumor sites between the two groups was derived from an excess of upper sites in non-FGC female probands. Conclusion: Distribution of associated non-GCs in a family history of GC may vary with geographic areas. GC may have different genetic and/or environmental etiology in different families, and a certain subtype may be inherited in a female-influenced fashion.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To investigate 30-year treatment outcomes associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) at a tertiary hospital in China. Methods: A total of 256 patients diagnosed with primary BCS at our tertiary hospital between November 1983 and September 2013 were followed and retrospectively studied. Cumulative survival rates and cumulative mortality rates of major causes were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the independent predictors of survival were identified using a Cox regression model. Results: Thirty-four patients were untreated; however, 222 patients were treated by medicine, surgery, or interventional radiology. Forty-four patients were lost to follow-up; however, 212 patients were followed, 67 of whom died. The symptom remission rates of treated and untreated patients were 81.1% (107/132) and 46.2% (6/13), respectively (P = 0.009). The cumulative 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year survival rates of the treated patients were 93.5%, 81.6%, 75.2%, 64.7%, and 58.2%, respectively; however, the 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year survival rates of the untreated patients were 70.8%, 70.8%, 53.1%, 0%, and unavailable, respectively (P = 0.007).

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study was conducted to explore the application of age-male-ALBI-platelets (aMAP) score for predicting late recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and develop an aMAP score based-nomogram to predict prognosis in Chinese population. Materials and methods: HCC patients who developed late recurrence following RFA at National Cancer Center (NCC) of China, First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University and Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from January 2011 to December 2016 were included as a training cohort, and patients who were treated at Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University between January 2012 and December 2016 were included as an external validation cohort. The optimal cut-off value for aMAP score was determined using X-tile software to discriminate the performance of recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results: A total of 339 eligible patients were included in this study. Patients were grouped into low-risk (aMAP score ≤64.2), medium-risk (64.3 ≤aMAP score ≤68.6) and high-risk (aMAP score ≥68.7) groups by X-tile plots. The prognostic factors that affected RFS were the number of lesions and aMAP score. A nomogram was constructed to predict the RFS with a C-index of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.744-0.842). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (t-AUCs) of the nomogram to predict 3, 4 and 5-year RFS were 0.808, 0.820 and 0.764, respectively. The model was then tested with data from an external validation cohort. The calibration curve confirmed the optimal agreement between the predicted and observed values. Conclusion: The aMAP score provided a well-discriminated risk stratification and is an independent prognostic factor for the late recurrence of HCC following RFA. The aMAP score-based nomogram could help to strengthen prognosis-based decision making and formulate adjuvant therapeutic and preventive strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Though regular surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for high-risk patients is widely recommended, its rate and effectiveness are not clear. The aim of this study is to investigate the actual rate of HCC surveillance and its related factors and to clarify its impact on survival in a Korean HCC cohort. Materials and methods: From 2012 to 2015, 319 newly diagnosed HCC patients were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital. Patient interviews based on a structured questionnaire survey were conducted. Surveillance was defined as liver imaging test ≥ 2 times with at least 3-month interval within 2 years prior to HCC diagnosis. Results: Surveillance rate was 39.8%. Of the HCC patients with high-risk factors, only 182 (57.1%) had knowledge for the need for regular surveillance, and 141 (44.2%) had the accurate information about the method (ultrasound-based study). Surveillance group showed a higher proportion of early HCC (p < 0.001) and a longer overall survival (p < 0.001) compared to non-surveillance group. The multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated Child-Pugh class A, history of anti-viral therapy, low serum α-fetoprotein level, non-advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage as independent predictors of overall survival, while regular surveillance was not (p=0.436). Conclusion: Less than half of the newly diagnosed Korean HCC patients were under surveillance and the accurate perception for the need of HCC surveillance was insufficient. Of those under surveillance, most patients were diagnosed with early stage HCC, which led to the improved survival. Comprehensive efforts to optimize the surveillance program for the target population are warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus. Aims: To identify the genetic basis in a family with 3 generations of diabetes and to assess the concordance between the genotype and phenotype. Methods: A molecular analysis was performed on genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and sequencing. A mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) was performed with/without glibenclamide. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on all family members with diabetes due to the location of the mutation. Results: A novel c.618G>A, p.W206X termination mutation was identified in the hepatic nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) gene. The mutation was identified in the proband and 8 of the 14 family members tested. An MMTT stimulus (±2.5 and 5 mg glibenclamide) produced a similar glucose profile and C-peptide graph in both the obese proband and her nonobese mother, showing no effect of the glibenclamide. No evidence of liver adenomas was found in the abdominal ultrasonography. Conclusions: We described a novel c.618G>A, p.W206X mutation in HNF1α associated with MODY 3 but not with hepatocellular adenoma. In contradistinction to most MODY 3 mutations, treatment with sulphonylurea was found to be a clinically ineffective alternative to insulin therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Growing evidence suggests that genetic predisposition significantly increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), independently from the presence of other risk factors. Here, we report a novel germline DICER1 mutation associated with familial recurrent liver tumors. We then aimed to investigate the contribution of constitutional and somatic DICER1 mutations on HCC occurrence. Methods: We investigated two individuals of a single family that developed recurrent well-differentiated hepatocellular tumors over the years. Histological slides from surgically resected tumors were reviewed. Exome sequencing was performed on constitutional DNA from circulating lymphocytes in both patients. The presence of somatic DICER1 mutations was analyzed in 243 liver tumors. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing was performed in 50 liver tumors to identify groups of tumors with similar profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). Results: A pathological study identified hepatocellular adenomas and well-differentiated carcinomas in both patients. Tumors exhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, with strong and diffuse glutamine synthetase expression. Interestingly, non-tumor liver tissues showed abnormal liver zonation as previously reported in Dicer1 knockout mouse livers. Screening for DICER1 mutations in 243 sporadic liver tumors identified six tumors with somatic DICER1 mutations. In HCCs, DICER1 mutations were significantly associated with CTNNB1 mutations (p=0.03). miRNA profiling identified a specific expression profile in DICER1-mutated tumors with a decreased expression of mature miRNAs compared to the other samples. Among the DEMs, downregulation of let-7a and miR-365b was closely related to DICER1 mutations. Conclusions: Our results highlight the role of DICER1 mutations in liver carcinogenesis in a specific subtype of familial and sporadic hepatocellular carcinomas associated with β-catenin activation. Lay summary: DICER1 germline mutations are known to predispose individuals to the development of malignant tumors, mainly pleuropulmonary blastoma and ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. Here, we described familial HCC associated with a novel DICER1 germline mutation and altered liver zonation. Familial and sporadic HCCs carrying DICER1 mutations are associated with CTNNB1 mutation and characterized by a reduced expression of specific mature miRNAs.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade has been evaluated as an objective method to assess liver function and predict postoperative complications, particularly after hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, ALBI grade was rarely used in evaluation in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). MATERIAL AND METHODS Between March 2005 and November 2015, 272 consecutive patients undergoing right-lobe LDLT were enrolled in this study. According to the ALBI score used to evaluate recipients preoperatively, those patients were divided into 3 grades (I, II, and III). Demographic findings and the post-operative complication rates were collected and compared among groups. RESULTS The proportions of massive blood cell transfusions were different among those 3 grades (p<0.05). The patients in grade III had a higher risk of bacterial pneumonia and early allograft dysfunction (EAD) compared to grade I (p=0.029 and p=0.038, respectively) and grade II (p=0.006 and p=0.007, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ALBI, Child-Pugh, and MELD for predicting 30-day mortality were 0.702 (95% CI: 0.644-0.756), 0.669 (95% CI: 0.580-0.697, p=0.510, versus ALBI grade), and 0.540 (95% CI: 0.580-0.697, p=0.144, versus ALBI grade), respectively. CONCLUSIONS ALBI grade was a good index for predicting post-operative complications and had a predictive ability similar to those of the Child-Pugh classification and MELD score.",

    "Abstract": "Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) carry heterozygous mutations of the APC gene. At a young age, these patients develop multiple colorectal adenomas that consistently display a second somatic mutation in the remaining APC wild-type allele. Inactivation of APC leads to impaired degradation of beta-catenin, thereby promoting continuous cell-cycle progression. The role of APC inactivation in rare extracolonic tumors of FAP patients has not been characterized sufficiently. Among tissue specimen from 174 patients with known APC germ-line mutations, we identified 8 tumors infrequently seen in FAP. To investigate the pathogenic role of APC pathway deregulation in these lesions, they were analyzed for second-hit somatic mutations in the mutational cluster region of the APC gene. Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare the expression pattern of beta-catenin to the mutational status of the APC gene. Exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) was analyzed for activating mutations to investigate alternative mechanisms of elevated beta-catenin concentration. Although CTNNB1 mutations were not observed, second somatic APC mutations were found in 4 of the 8 tumors: a uterine adenocarcinoma, a hepatocellular adenoma, an adrenocortical adenoma, and an epidermal cyst. These tumors showed an elevated concentration of beta-catenin. No APC mutations were seen in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver, angiofibrolipoma, and seborrheic wart. This is the first study reporting second somatic APC mutations in FAP-associated uterine adenocarcinoma and epidermal cysts. Furthermore, our data strengthen a role for impaired APC function in the pathogenesis of adrenal and hepatic neoplasms in FAP patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Everolimus is the hydroxyethyl derivative of sirolimus and a strong inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This drug has immunosuppressive and anticancer activities and the present in vitro study was aimed at identifying the cellular and molecular profiles of breast cancer cells predictive of sensitivity to everolimus. Materials and methods: MCF-7, T-47D, ZR-75-1, CAMA-1, HCC-1500 and MCF-10A cells were used and viability was assessed using WST-1 dye. Sensitivity to everolimus was correlated with phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473/Thr308), mTOR (Ser2448), and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and mutational profile of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2 and FRAP genes. Protein phosphorylation was evaluated by AlphaScreen SureFire, while the mutational status was examined by digital droplet PCR and Sanger sequencing. Results: Everolimus showed a transient growth inhibition in non-tumorigenic cells, while in tumorigenic lines the drug suppressed the proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner but with different potency (IC50) and efficacy (Emax), being ZR-75-1 the most sensitive and T47D the least sensitive. MCF-7, T47D and HCC1500 had activating mutations in PIK3CA gene, while loss-of-activity PTEN mutations were detected in sensitive cell lines, including ZR-75-1, which showed no changes or minimal increase in the amount of p-AKT(Ser473/Thr308) and p-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204) induced by everolimus compared to the resistant cell line T47D in which phosphorylation of AKT and ERK was increased. Conclusions: Cellular levels of p-AKT(Ser473/Thr308) and p-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204), activating mutations of PIK3CA and inactivating mutations of PTEN may predict response to everolimus in breast cancer cells; these findings have potential applications for treatment personalization of everolimus in breast cancer patients.",

Loss of Fbxw7 expression is frequently observed in various human cancers. In the present study, we examined the role of Fbxw7 expression in both non-tumor liver tissues and tumor tissues on clinicopathological significance. Methods: Sixty-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who underwent hepatectomy, were divided into two groups: high and low gene-expression group, based on the Fbxw7 expression level. We compared the clinicopathological factors between the high expression and low expression groups in both tumor and non-tumor tissues. Results: Fbxw7 messenger RNA expression level in the non-tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in the tumor tissues. In the analysis of Fbxw7 expression in tumor and non-tumor tissues, disease-free survival rate in the Fbxw7 high expression group was significantly higher than that in the low expression group. In multivariable analysis, Fbxw7 low expression in both tumor and non-tumor tissue was detected as the strongest independent risk factor for HCC recurrence. Conclusions: Low Fbxw7 expression in both tumor and non-tumor tissue may be an independent prognostic factor for tumor recurrence after hepatectomy in patients with HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human malignancies and also the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. The mechanisms underlying the progression and metastasis of HCC remain unclear. The E3 ubiquitin ligase F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbxw7) is broadly considered as a tumor suppressor gene. However, the role of Fbxw7 in HCC is not clear. To investigate the expression and biological functions of Fbxw7 in HCC, we examined Fbxw7 expression level using HCC tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that Fbxw7 expression is significantly reduced in HCC compared with non-cancerous tissues (P<0.05). Fbxw7 levels were significantly associated with tumor differentiation (P=0.013), the incidence of portal or hepatic venous invasion (P=0.031), metastasis (P=0.027) and AJCC cancer stage (P=0.047). Then, we observed a strong correlation between low Fbxw7 expression and a worse 5-year survival of HCC patients (P<0.001). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that the Fbxw7 expression (P<0.001) was an independent factor for the prediction of the overall survival of HCC patients. We also found that both Fbxw7 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in HCC cell lines compared with human liver non-tumor cell line. Moreover, our in vitro experiments showed a remarkable increase of cell migration and invasion in Fbxw7-knockdown cells and a decrease in Fbxw7-overexpress cells. In addition, the present study demonstrated that Fbxw7 is involved in the migration and invasion of HCC cells via regulating Notch1 and the downstream molecules of Notch1. Taken together, our findings indicate that Fbxw7 can be used as a prognostic marker; it has an important role in HCC progression and inhibits HCC cell migration and invasion through the Notch1 signaling pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To observe the expression of Fbxw7 and explore its correlation with cell proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The expression of Fbxw7 in paired tumor and tumor-adjacent normal tissues from 40 patients with HCC were assessed using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The expression level of Fbxw7 mRNA in normal liver cell line (LO2) and HCC cell lines (Hep3B and SMMC-7721) were detected by real-time RT-PCR. Colony formation assay and tumor xenograft assay were performed in different cell lines with different Fbxw7 expression respectively to investigate the ability of cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Results: The expression of Fbxw7 at both mRNA and protein levels in HCC tissues were significantly down-regulated compared to tumor-adjacent normal tissues (P<0.05). Down-regulation of Fbxw7 was found apparently associated with high Edmonson-Steiner classification and advanced TNM stage (P<0.05). The expression of Fbxw7 mRNA in LO2 was significantly higher than that in Hep3B or SMMC-7721 (P<0.05). Cell lines with less Fbxw7 expression had not only more colonies in colony formation assay (P<0.05), but also bigger xenografts in vitro (P<0.05). Conclusion: The low expression of Fbxw7 correlates with the poor clinicopathological characteristics and cell proliferation of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Deregulation of microRNA-92a (miR-92a) has been reported in several human cancers and is associated with prognosis of patients. However, the clinical significance of miR-92a and the underlying mechanisms involved in hepatocarcinogenesis remain to be determined. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of miR-92a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results showed that the expression of miR-92a was upregulated in HCC tissues as compared with matched tumor-adjacent tissues. A high expression of miR-92a was observed in HCC cell lines as compared with a non-transformed hepatic cell line. The gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that miR-92a significantly promoted proliferation and cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase, and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cell in vitro. In tumor‑bearing nude mice, the downregulation of miR-92a suppressed tumor growth of HCC in vivo. miR-92a was inversely correlated with F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7) expression in HCC tissues. Furthermore, miR-92a negatively regulated FBXW7 abundance in HCC cells. In the present study, FBXW7 was identified as a direct target of miR-92a. Notably, alterations of FBXW7 expression abrogated the effects of miR-92a on HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. Clinical association analysis revealed that a high expression of miR-92a was correlated with poor prognostic characteristics of HCC. Notably, the high expression of miR-92a conferred a reduced 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of HCC patients. The multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that miR-92a expression was an independent prognostic marker for predicting survival of HCC patients. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that miR-92a promotes the tumor growth of HCC by targeting FBXW7 and may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.",

To investigate the levels of COX-2 and VEGF expression in chronic hepatitis (CH), cirrhosis, and HCC. Methods: The immunohistochemical expressions of COX-2 and VEGF were evaluated in tissues from patients with CH (n=95), cirrhosis (n=38), low-grade HCC (LG-HCC; n=6), and high-grade HCC (HG-HCC; n=29). Results: The COX-2 expression scores in CH, cirrhosis, LG-HCC, and HG-HCC were 3.3±1.9 (mean±SD), 4.2±1.7, 5.5±1.0, and 3.4±2.4, respectively (CH vs. cirrhosis, P=0.016; CH vs. LG-HCC, P=0.008; LG-HCC vs. HG-HCC, P=0.004), and the corresponding VEGF expression scores were 0.9±0.8, 1.5±0.7, 1.8±0.9, and 1.6±1.1 (CH vs. cirrhosis, P<0.001; CH vs. LG-HCC, P=0.011; LG-HCC vs. HG-HCC, P=0.075). Both factors were correlated with the fibrosis stage in CH and cirrhosis (COX-2: r=0.427, P<0.001; VEGF: r=0.491, P<0.001). There was a significant correlation between COX-2 and VEGF in all of the tissue samples (r=0.648, P<0.001), and between high COX-2 and VEGF expression scores and survival (COX-2: P=0.001; VEGF: P<0.001). Conclusions: The expressions of both COX-2 and VEGF are significantly higher in cirrhosis and LG-HCC than in CH. High COX-2 and high VEGF expressions are associated with a high survival rate.",

    "Abstract": "Over 30 million prescriptions of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are issued every year. Considering that these drugs are available without a prescription as over the counter (OTC) drugs, their use will be astronomical. With the increasing use of NSAIDs, their adverse effects are drawing attention. Especially, stomach bleeding, kidney toxicity, liver toxicity, and neurological toxicity are reported as common. Ibuprofen, one of the extensively used NSAIDs along with aspirin, can also induce liver toxicity, but few studies are addressing this point. Here we examined the liver toxicity of ibuprofen and investigated whether co-exposure to ethanol can manifest synergistic effects. We employed 2D and 3D cultured human hepatoma cells, HepG2 to examine the synergistic hepatotoxicity of ibuprofen and alcohol concerning cell viability, morphology, and histology of 3D spheroids. As a result, ibuprofen and alcohol provoked synergistic hepatotoxicity against hepatocytes, and their toxicity increased prominently in 3D culture upon extended exposure. Oxidative stress appeared to be the mechanisms underlying the synergistic toxicity of ibuprofen and alcohol as evidenced by increased production of ROS and expression of the endogenous antioxidant system. Collectively, this study has demonstrated that ibuprofen and EtOH can induce synergistic hepatotoxicity, providing a line of evidence for caution against the use of ibuprofen in combination with alcohol.",

Methods: Our study retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of 64 patients with PCCCL (PCCCL group) and 247 with nonclear cell hepatocellular carcinoma (NHCC group) after hepatectomy between January 1996 and December 2006. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival of the two groups was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors of survival were identified by multivariate analysis. Results: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS (P=0.016) and disease-free survival (P<0.001) of the PCCCL group were significantly higher than that of the NHCC group. In mutivariate analysis, tumor size >5 cm, presence of portal vein tumor thrombosis and proportion of clear cells ≤70% were risk factors for OS of the PCCCL group. The prognosis of a subgroup with higher proportion of clear cells was markedly better than that of the subgroup with a lower proportion of clear cells. Conclusion: Our results suggested that the prognosis of patients with PCCCL was better than that of the patients with NHCC. The higher the proportion of clear cells, the better the prognosis.",

    "Abstract": "miR-122, the expression of which is regulated by several transcription factors, such as HNF1A, was recently reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and hepatocellular carcinoma. HNF1A variants can cause diabetes and might be involved in the development of primary liver neoplasm. Differences in miR-122 expression among different types of diabetes have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate differences in serum miR-122 levels in Chinese patients with different forms of diabetes, including T2DM, type 1 diabetes (T1DM), HNF1A variant-induced diabetes (HNF1A-DM), glucokinase variant-induced diabetes (GCK-DM), and mitochondrial A3243G mutation-induced diabetes (MDM). In total, 12 HNF1A-DM patients, 24 gender-, age-, and body mass index-matched (1 : 2) T2DM patients and 24 healthy subjects were included in this study. In addition, 30 monogenic diabetes (11 GCK-DM and 19 MDM) and 17 T1DM patients were included. Fasted blood biochemistry and miR-122 were measured. The results showed that the HNF1A-DM patients had lower miR-122 levels [0.046 (0.023, 0.121)] than T2DM patients [0.165 (0.036, 0.939), P = 0.02] and healthy controls [0.249 (0.049, 1.234), P = 0.019]. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for miR-122 to discriminate HNF1A-DM and T2DM was 0.687 (95% CI: 0.52-0.86, P = 0.07). There was no difference in serum miR-122 among HNF1A-DM, GCK-DM, MDM, and T1DM patients. Lower serum miR-122 is a unique feature of HNF1A-DM patients and might partially explain the increased risk for liver neoplasm and abnormal lipid metabolism in HNF1A-DM patients.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) encompass a wide range of illnesses, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and viral hepatitis. Deterioration of liver capacity, with subsequent progression into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ultimately leads to a further decrease in the hepatic reserve. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring system is the standard tool for assessing underlying liver reserve capacity in routine practice and in clinical trials of CLD and HCC. In this review, we highlight the clinical significance of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and the growth hormone (GH) signaling pathway in HCC. IGF-I could be a marker for liver reserve capacity in CLDs and HCC in clinical practice. This approach could improve the risk assessment and stratifications of patients on the basis of their underlying liver reserve, either before active treatment in routine practice or before they are enrolled in clinical trials.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly recognized as a cause of chronic liver disease, often resulting in liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma damaging outcomes. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are indicators of hepatocellular injury. Several studies have demonstrated that high ALT levels are correlated with higher nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) risk. The aim was to determine the correlation of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase with liver stiffness in Vietnamese patients with NAFLD. Patients and methods: The study included 18 to 80 years old patients diagnosed with fatty liver on ultrasound at the University of Medical Center (UMC) liver clinic. Liver stiffness was measured using transient elastography. The histopathological, demographic, and laboratory data of the participants were also collected. The baseline and clinical characteristics of NAFLD patients were stratified by serum ALT levels. Results: There were 138 NAFLD patients, including 82 men (59.4%) and 56 women (40.6%) (mean ± SD age of 41 ± 11 years). Liver fibrosis (F0) between the two groups showed no significant difference (p = 0.469). Similarly, no difference was found in the mild fibrosis level (F2) of the two groups of patients (p = 0.371). ALT level was significantly higher in NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis (F3, F4) (3.2% vs 15.9%, p = 0.0013; 3.2% vs 13.2%, p = 0.0047, respectively). NAFLD patients with mild to moderate fibrosis (F1-F2) were detected at 59 U/L cut-off value with 67% sensitivity and 51% specificity. However, severe fibrosis and/or cirrhosis patients (F3-F4) had a cut-off value of 81 U/L with 53% sensitivity and 67% specificity in patients. Conclusion: Using ALT level as a marker for severe NAFLD would consider high-risk patients as mild cases, even though there is still the risk of progressive and severe hepatic disease. Our study underlines the small contribution of ALT as an independent factor for detecting NAFLD severity.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Liver tissue situated outside the liver with a hepatic connection is usually called an accessory liver, and that without a connection to the mother liver, is called ectopic liver tissue. Aim: To identify studies in the literature on ectopic liver tissue located on the gallbladder surface or mesentery. Methods: We present two patients and review published articles on ectopic liver tissue located on the gallbladder surface accessed via PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Google databases. Keywords used included accessory liver lobe, aberrant liver tissue, ectopic liver tissue, ectopic liver nodule, heterotopic liver tissue, hepatic choristoma, heterotopic liver tissue on the gallbladder, and ectopic liver tissue on the gallbladder. The search included articles published before June 2020 with no language restriction. Letters to the editor, case reports, review articles, original articles, and meeting presentations were included in the search. Articles or abstracts containing adequate information on age, sex, history of liver disease, preliminary diagnosis, radiologic tools, lesion size, surgical indication, surgical procedure, and histopathological features of ectopic liver tissue were included in the study. Results: A total of 72 articles involving 91 cases of ectopic liver tissue located on the gallbladder surface or mesentery were analyzed. Of these 91 patients, 62 were female and 25 were male (no gender available for 4 patients), and the age range was 5 d to 91 years. Forty-nine patients underwent surgery for chronic cholecystitis or cholelithiasis, and 14 patients underwent surgery for acute cholecystitis. The remaining 28 patients underwent laparotomy for other reasons. Cholecystectomy was laparoscopic in 69 patients and open in 11 patients. The remaining 19 patients underwent various other surgical procedures such as autopsy, liver transplantation, living donor hepatectomy, Whipple procedure, and liver segment V resection. Histopathologically, hepatocellular carcinoma was detected in the ectopic liver tissue of one patient. Conclusion: Ectopic liver tissue is a rare developmental anomaly which is usually detected incidentally. Although most studies suggest that ectopic liver located outside the gallbladder has a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, this is not reflected in statistical analysis.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis caused by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease. HCV is transmitted by injection drug use, blood transfusion, hemodialysis, organ transplantation and less frequently sexual intercourse. It has been recognized as a global health problem because of the progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Globally, about 170 million people are infected with HCV. Since the discovery of this virus in 1989, the clinical management of chronic hepatitis C infection has undergone a paradigm shift from alpha interferon to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. However, resistance to many of these antiviral agents has been reported increasingly from all over the globe. This review article focuses on the emerging HCV resistance to DAAs and the relevance of in vitro DAA resistance testing in clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Gonadal germ cell tumors continue to be the cause of diverse, diagnostically challenging issues for the pathologist, and their correct resolution often has major important therapeutic and prognostic implications. They are academically interesting because of the biological diversity exhibited in the two gonads and variation in frequency of certain neoplasms. The most dramatic examples of the latter are the frequency of dermoid cyst in the ovary compared to the testis and the reverse pertaining to embryonal carcinoma. Within the teratoma group, there is strong evidence that ovarian and prepubertal testicular teratomas are derived from benign germ cells, a pathogenesis that likely applies also to the rare dermoid cysts and uncommon epidermoid cysts of the testis. In contrast, postpubertal testicular teratomas derive from malignant germ cells, specifically representing differentiation within a preexistent nonteratomatous cancer. As expected, given the foregoing, teratomas in boys are clinically benign, whereas in postpubertal males they are malignant, independent of their degree of immaturity. On the other hand, immaturity is an important finding in ovarian teratomas, irrespective of age, although its significance in children has recently been challenged. It is usually recognized on the basis of embryonic-appearing neuroepithelium, which shows mitotic activity and apoptosis in contrast to differentiated neuroepithelial tissues, which may occur in mature ovarian teratomas. Rarely it is based on the presence of cellular, mitotically active glial tissue. Fetal-type tissues alone are not sufficient for a diagnosis of immature teratoma. Further differences between the teratomatous tumors in the two gonads are the relative frequency of monodermal teratomas in the ovary in contrast to the testis, where only one subset, carcinoids, is seen with any frequency. When uncommon somatic-type malignancies (usually squamous cell carcinoma) occur in mature cystic teratomas of the ovary, this is a de novo form of malignant transformation; similar tumors in the testis, a very rare event, represent overgrowth of teratomatous elements that originated from malignant, nonteratomatous germ cell tumors and, therefore, had previously undergone malignant transformation. Germinomas may have several unusual features in each gonad; these include microcystic arrangements that suggest yolk sac tumor, tubular patterns that mimic Sertoli cell tumor, apparent increased cytological atypia that causes concern for embryonal carcinoma, and prominent syncytiotrophoblast giant cells that suggest choriocarcinoma. Awareness of these variants, good technical preparations, the retained typical cytological features of germinoma cells, and the judicious use of tailored panels of immunohistochemical stains resolve these dilemmas in virtually all instances. Two aspects of germinomas are unique to the testis. Firstly, intertubular growth of small seminomas may cause them to be overlooked. Secondly, the distinctive spermatocytic seminoma occurs only in the testis. A newly recognized aspect of this tumor is the propensity for some to be relatively monomorphic, making them apt to be mistaken for usual seminoma or embryonal carcinoma, although the characteristic polymorphic appearance in some foci, absence of intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified type, and immunohistochemical stains should prevent this error. Cytoplasmic membrane immunoreactivity for placental alkaline phosphatase and CD117, with usual negativity for AE1/AE3 cytokeratins, is helpful in the diagnosis of germinoma. The recently described marker, OCT3/4, a nuclear transcription factor, is especially helpful in the differential of germinoma and embryonal carcinoma with other neoplasms. Yolk sac tumor continues to be confused occasionally with clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. Glandular ('endometrioid-like') yolk sac tumors mimic endometrioid carcinomas; predominant or pure hepatoid yolk sac tumors cause concern for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma or, in the ovary, primary hepatoid carcinoma, and solid patterns, especially in limited samplings, may be misinterpreted as germinoma. The usually younger age of patients with yolk sac tumors helps with the differential considerations with the nongerm cell tumors, as do other clinical and microscopic features and selected immunohistochemical stains. Choriocarcinoma is rare in both gonads, and those in the ovary must be distinguished from metastatic tumors of placental origin. Syncytiotrophoblast cells alone, admixed with other forms of germ cell tumor, still are confused with choriocarcinoma, but this phenomenon, which is much more frequent than choriocarcinoma, lacks the plexiform arrangement of different trophoblast cell types that typifies the latter. Mixed germ cell tumors (which may show almost any combination of components) are common in the testis but rare in the ovary. A separately categorized, rare form of mixed germ cell tumor seen in both gonads is the polyembryoma. It is perhaps the most photogenic of all gonadal germ cell tumors and is also intriguing because of its distinctive, organized arrangement of yolk sac tumor and embryonal carcinoma elements and recapitulation of very early embryonic development, even to the extent of having in its fundamental unit, the embryoid body, a miniature yolk sac, and amniotic cavity. These tumors, which are constituted by innumerable embryoid bodies, almost always contain teratomatous glands in minor amounts, and one way of viewing the polyembryoma is to consider it the most immature form of teratoma. Embryoid bodies are also common as a minor component of many mixed germ cell tumors, particularly in the testis, and the diffuse embryoma is another variant that has a particular arrangement of yolk sac tumor and embryonal carcinoma elements. Regression of gonadal germ cell tumors is a phenomenon restricted to the testis, for unknown reasons. These so-called 'burnt-out' germ cell tumors can be recognized by a distinctive constellation of findings, including sometimes minor foci of residual recognizable germ cell neoplasia, a well-defined zone of scarring (often having residual ghost tubules), associated lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, intratubular calcification and, in about 50%, of in situ germ cell neoplasia.",

    "Abstract": "Flt3 is expressed by early myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells and it regulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Flt3 is activated by the Flt3 ligand, the monomeric form of which is a polypeptide of about 200 amino acid residues. Both membrane-associated and soluble Flt3 ligands, which are a product of the same gene, function as noncovalent dimers. FLT3 mutations occur in about one-third of newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. This disease is a malignancy of hematopoietic progenitor cells with a variable clinical course; the incidence of this disorder is more than twice that of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemias (20,000 vs. 8500 new patients per year, respectively, in the United States). FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) results from the head-to-tail duplication of from one to more than 100 amino acids within the juxtamembrane domain and such duplication occurs in about 20-25 % of patients with acute myelogenous leukemias. FLT3 tyrosine kinase (FLT3 TK) mutations, usually within the activation segment, occur in 5-10 % of these patients. The mainstay for the care of acute myelogenous leukemias include daunorubicin or idarubicin and cytarabine. Older patients who are not candidates for such traditional therapy are usually given 5-azacitidine, decitabine, or clofarabine. The addition of orally effective small molecule Flt3 inhibitors to these therapies may prolong event-free and overall survival, a subject of ongoing clinical studies. Midostaurin is US FDA-approved in combination with standard cytarabine and daunorubicin for first-line induction chemotherapy and in combination with cytarabine for second-line consolidation chemotherapy in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemias with FLT3-postive mutations. Moreover, gilteritinib is a Flt3 multikinase inhibitor that is also FDA approved for the care of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemias with FLT3 mutations. Quizartinib is a Flt3 multikinase inhibitor that was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory Flt3-positive acute myelogenous leukemias. Gilteritinib and quizartinib bind to Flt3 with the inactive DFG-Dout structure and are classified as type II inhibitors. Furthermore, ponatinib is a multikinase inhibitor that is approved as therapy for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic and chronic myelogenous leukemias; it is used off label for the treatment of patients with acute myelogenous leukemias. Moreover, sorafenib is FDA-approved for the treatment of hepatocellular, renal cell, and differentiated thyroid cancers and it is used off label as maintenance therapy following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemias. Other drugs that are in clinical trials for the treatment of this disorder include sunitinib, crenolanib, FF10101, and lestaurtinib. Unlike chronic myelogenous leukemias, which result solely from the formation of the BCR-Abl chimeric protein kinase, acute myelogenous leukemias result from multi-factorial causes and are prone to be resistant to both cytotoxic and targeted therapies. Consequently, there is a pressing need for better understanding the etiologies of acute myelogenous leukemias and for the development of more effective therapies.",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian germ cell tumors are reviewed with emphasis on recent developments. In the primitive germ cell tumor group the recently recognized subtypes of yolk sac tumor, the hepatoid and glandular variants are described. Hepatoid tumors, which resemble hepatocellular carcinomas, are usually admixed with other patterns of yolk sac neoplasia but when the hepatoid component predominates, distinction from metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma may be difficult. Glandular yolk sac tumors include those with a cribriform pattern as well as tumors that may be confused with endometrioid carcinoma. Within the teratoma category, a recent paper exploring the occasional relation between immature teratomas and dermoid cysts is reviewed. Problems caused by some of the monodermal teratomas are also highlighted. Struma ovarii may be the source of many diagnostic problems. It may be cystic and microscopic examination may reveal inconspicuous numbers of clearly recognizable thyroid follicles, resulting in confusion with other cystic ovarian tumors. In noncystic strumas many patterns, such as solid or pseudotubular, may be seen and the presence of cells with abundant clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm may add to the diagnostic difficulty, particularly if other teratomatous elements are lacking. Immunohistochemical staining for thyroglobulin may be crucial in establishing the diagnosis of a struma in these situations. The problem of identifying reliable criteria for malignancy of struma ovarii is explored on the basis of recent information. The two most recently recognized subtypes of carcinoid tumor, strumal and mucinous, are reviewed as are primary neuroectodermal and sebaceous tumors of the ovary. Unusual clinical features of germ cell tumors are discussed under three main categories: endocrine syndromes, paraendocrine and paraneoplastic syndromes, and miscellaneous. Included in these categories are disorders such as sexual precocity in association with germ cell tumors containing syncytiotrophoblast cells, endocrine abnormalities associated with the recently described functioning ovarian tumors with peripheral steroid cell proliferation, hyperthyroidism with struma ovarii, the carcinoid syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with dermoid cysts, complications of dermoid cyst rupture, which may simulate disseminated carcinomatosis, and ascites and Meigs' syndrome associated with struma ovarii.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The relationship between HCV genotype and the development of more serious liver disease has not been clearly established. This study was to investigate the distribution pattern of HCV genotypes in Korea and their relationship to the viremic level and to progression of chronic liver disease. Methods: Study population was 217 patients with type C chronic liver disease. They were divided into 4 groups; 83 patients with near-normal ALT (group 1), 64 patients with elevated ALT (group 2), 20 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (group 3) and 50 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (group 4). HCV genotypes were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using mixed primer sets, and then the fidelity of genotyping was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. HCV RNA concentration was measured by quantitative competitive RT-PCR for 23 patients in group 2. Results: The genotypes could be determined in 166 (76%) out of 217 patients. Type 1b and type 2a were predominantly occurring over the other types in somewhat similar frequency (45% and 51%, respectively). The genotype distribution of type 1b and 2a among four different groups showed 42% and 54% in group 1, 49% and 45% in group 2, 53% and 47% in group 3 and 41% and 57% in group 4; thus there was no significant difference in genotype distribution among 4 different disease groups. However, the viremia levels in patients with genotype 1b infection were significantly higher than those with genotype 2a. Conclusion: Genotype 2a infection is as prevalent as genotype 1b in Korea, and genotype 2a infection may pose no less risk for progression of disease despite lower replication level than genotype lb infection.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Paraneoplastic syndromes are characterized by atypical clinical manifestations. Several reports of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) paraneoplastic phenomena have been reported. They usually manifest as one type in an individual, but it is not common for the two clinical manifestations to occur simultaneously. Case summary: A 52-year-old female patient was admitted to hospital with pale skin and numbness of the second to fifth fingers in the left hand, which rapidly developed into severe digital ischemia. Computed tomography angiography revealed uneven thickness of the left ulnar artery with severe local luminal stenosis. Blood analysis during hospitalization showed persistent mild to medium thrombocytopenia and insensitive to hormonal therapy. Antiphospholipid antibody testing showed high titer of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLs), IgA aCLs, IgG anti-β2-glycoprotein-I (anti-β2 GPI), and IgA anti-β2 GPI. The exact diagnosis was HCC when the high a-fetoprotein levels, computed tomography findings, and the history of chronic hepatitis B came together. This was a rare case of coexisting manifestations as presenting symptoms of malignancy-associated antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient underwent several operations, antithrombotic treatments and hormonal therapy. However, the patient refused chemotherapy and died 8 wk after diagnosis. Conclusion: This report highlights the importance of atypical clinical changes that could alert the physicians to vigilance for a concomitant underlying malignancy.",

    "Abstract": "The insulin receptor (IR) exists as two isoforms, IR-A and IR-B, which result from alternative splicing of exon 11 in the primary transcript. This alternative splicing is cell specific, and the relative proportions of exon 11 isoforms also vary during development, aging, and different disease states. We have previously demonstrated that both intron 10 and exon 11 contain regulatory sequences that affect IR splicing both positively and negatively. In this study, we sought to define the precise sequence elements within exon 11 that control exon recognition and cellular factors that recognize these elements. Using minigenes carrying linker-scanning mutations within exon 11, we detected both exonic splicing enhancer and exonic splicing silencer elements. We identified binding of SRp20 and SF2/ASF to the exonic enhancers and CUG-BP1 to the exonic silencer by RNA affinity chromatography. Overexpression and knockdown studies with hepatoma and embryonic kidney cells demonstrated that SRp20 and SF2/ASF increase exon inclusion but that CUG-BP1 causes exon skipping. We found that CUG-BP1 also binds to an additional intronic splicing silencer, located at the 3' end of intron 10, to promote exon 11 skipping. Thus, we propose that SRp20, SF2/ASF, and CUG-BP1 act antagonistically to regulate IR alternative splicing in vivo and that the relative ratios of SRp20 and SF2/ASF to CUG-BP1 in different cells determine the degree of exon inclusion.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a major contributor to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and major global public health problem that causes mortality in both developed and developing countries.For the past decade, treatment with pegylated interferon (peg interferon α) and ribavirin (RBV) has been associated with rates of sustained virologic response of ≤ 66% among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In this study, we report the response rate of Iranian treatment-naïve CHC patients to Pegaferon, a locally developed pegylated interferon-α2a (PEG-IFNα2a). METHODS Patients diagnosed with CHC who referred to two university based outpatient clinics in Tehran from December 2007 to May 2011 were enrolled in a single-group, open-labeled experimental design. Eligible patients were above 15 years of age and had HCV infection with evidence of chronic hepatitis. Exclusion criteria included the presence of a debilitating disease, decompensated cirrhosis or refusal to participate in the study. Patients were treated with 180μg Pegaferon weekly in addition to 800-1200 mg daily, weight-based RBV for 24 or 48 weeks depending on genotype. Viral response and adverse effects were recorded. RESULTS A total of 216 patients were enrolled in the study of which 83.3% were male and 16.7% were female. In 93 (43.1%) patients, the HCV RNA viral load was ≥ 800,000 IU/ml before starting treatment. \"As-treated analysis\" indicated that a total of 168 (77.8%) patients achieved sustained viral response (SVR, undetectable plasma HCV RNA 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment). CONCLUSION This study, with a larger number of participants, confirms the results of a previous study by the authors that Pegaferon, a PEG-IFNα 2a locally produced in Iran, is effective in treatment-naïve CHC patients.",

However, the functional role of hsa_circ_0008450 and its molecular mechanism are still unknown. Patients and methods: We used qRT-PCR and Western blot to examine the expression levels of hsa_circ_0008450, microRNA-214-3p (miR-214-3p), and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) protein. CCK8 assay and wound healing assay were used to detect cell viability and cell migration capability. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Luciferase reporter assay was used to explore the interaction among hsa_circ_0008450, miR-214-3p, and EZH2. Results: hsa_circ_0008450 was significantly increased in HCC tissues and cells. Furthermore, knockdown of hsa_circ_0008450 in HCC cells inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Mechanically, hsa_circ_0008450 promoted the expression of EZH2 protein through sponging miR-214-3p. Knockdown of circ_0008450 suppressed tumorigenesis of HCC cells in vivo. Conclusion: Knockdown of hsa_circ_0008450 inhibits HCC progression by regulating miR-214-3p/EZH2 axis.

    "Abstract": "We analyzed the p16INK4 status of 6 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and 32 primary HCC tumors, including 9 early-stage tumors, to determine whether p16INK4 tumor-suppressor gene inactivation participates in hepatocarcinogenesis. p16INK4 was studied at its protein level through Western blotting, at its messenger RNA (mRNA) level through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR) and Northern blotting, and at its genomic level through Southern blotting and PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The p16 protein was absent from 3 of 6 cell lines (50%) and 11 of 32 primary tumors (34%), but present in noncancerous tissues, indicating that p16INK4 is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, we suggest that the p16 protein loss may contribute to the following: (1) early-stage hepatocarcinogenesis, because it was observed in 22% of early stage tumors; and (2) tumor progression, because it occurred approximately twice as often in advanced rather than in early stage tumors (40%). It was striking that neither p16INK4 homozygous deletion and mutation nor loss of p16INK4 mRNA expression were observed in HCC cell lines and primary tumors, including those specimens from which the p16 protein was absent except the Li7HM cell line, in which p16INK4 mRNA was not detected. These results suggest that p16INK4 in HCC is inactivated predominantly by posttranscriptional regulation rather than by genomic aberrations and lack of transcription.",

    "Abstract": "One of the main regulatory pathways reported to be altered in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is that of cell cycle control involving RB1 gene-related cell inhibitors. We investigated p14(ARF), p15(INK4B), p16(INK4A), p18(INK4C), and RB1 genes in a series of HCCs and associated cirrhosis with the goal of ascertaining their pattern of inactivation by gene methylation. Thirty-three HCCs, adjacent nonneoplastic cirrhotic tissues, and 6 HCC cell lines were studied. Cirrhoses (25 of 33, 76%), HCCs (31 of 33, 94%), and 3 of 6 (50%) cell lines showed 1 or more methylated genes. Cirrhoses (17 of 33, 51%) had more frequently than HCCs (11 of 33, 33%, P =.01) only 1 methylated gene. With the exception of p18(INK4C) the genes under study showed promoter methylation with frequency ranging from 82% (p16(INK4A) in HCC) to 33% and 39% (p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) in cirrhoses). In cases with only 1 methylated gene, p15(INK4B) in cirrhosis (8 of 17, 47%) and p16(INK4A) in HCC (10 of 11, 91%) were the more frequently altered. An optimal correlation was found between p15 and p16 gene methylation and complete protein loss in HCC detected by immunocytochemistry, whereas a partial loss of the same proteins was a feature of methylated cirrhoses. Inactivation by DNA methylation of several genes of the RB1 pathway is common to cirrhosis and HCC. An early pattern of methylatory events (1 methylated gene) is a feature of cirrhosis rather than HCC, whereas an advanced one (> or = 3 methylated genes) is characteristic of malignancy. Early methylation changes seem to involve p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A) in cirrhosis and p16(INK4A) in HCC. In conclusion, a stepwise progression of methylating events is a feature of the sequence cirrhosis-HCC and contributes to the process of hepatic carcinogenesis with potential clinical implications.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor suppressor gene p16 (CDKN2/MTS-1/INK4A) is an important component of the cell cycle and inactivation of the gene has been found in a variety of human cancers. In order to investigate the role of p16 gene in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 48 cases of HCC were analysed for p16 alterations by: methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to determine the methylation status of the p16 promoter region; comparative multiplex PCR to detect homozygous deletion; PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing analysis to identify mutation of the p16 gene. We found high frequency of hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island of the p16 gene in 30 of 48 cases (62.5%) of HCC tumors. Moreover, homozygous deletion at p16 region were present in five of 48 cases (10.4%); and missense mutation were detected in three of 48 cases (6.3%). The overall frequency of p16 alterations, including homozygous deletion, mutation and hypermethylation, in HCC tumors was 70.8% (34 of 48 cases). These findings suggest that: (a) the inactivation of the p16 is a frequent event in HCC; (b) the p16 gene is inactivated by multiple mechanisms including homozygous deletion, promoter hypermethylation and point mutation; (c) the most common somatic alteration of the p16 gene in HCC is de novo hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island; and (d) in contrast to other studies, high frequency of genomic alterations are not uncommon in the 9p21 of the p16 gene. Our results strongly suggest that the p16 gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The INK4 locus consisting of three genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle, p16INK4a, p15INK4b, and p14ARF is often disrupted in human neoplasms. Methods: We analyzed the promoter methylation of each gene by methylation-specific PCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Results: The methylation of p16INK4a, p15INK4b, and p14ARF was found to occur in 27 (69.2%), seven (17.9%), and none out of 39 HCC tumors, respectively. Regarding corresponding nontumorous liver tissues, the promoter regions of p16INK4a, p15INK4b, and p14ARF were methylated in three (17.6%), three (17.6%), and none out of 17 samples, respectively. Analysis of mRNA expression revealed that loss of p16INK4a expression was frequently observed in HCC. In contrast, transcripts of p14ARF and p15INK4b were detected in 16 (88.9%) and 16 (88.9%) of 18 tumors, respectively. Conclusions: The frequent loss of transcription of p16INK4a with promoter methylation not only in the advanced but also in the early stages of HCC suggests that the epigenetic alteration of p16INK4a promoter is likely to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Together with the result of RT-PCR analysis, the role of aberrant methylation of p14ARF or p15INK4a promoter in hepatocarcinogenesis is thought to be limited.",

    "Abstract": "Epigenetic changes in gene expression due to extensive CpG island methylation is now accepted as the main cause of inactivation of the p16 gene. More recently, it has been suggested that the human ras association domain family (RASSF) 1 gene, cloned from the lung tumor-suppressor locus 3p21.3, also may be inactivated by methylation. It consists of two major alternative transcripts, RASSF1A and RASSF1C. Epigenetic inactivation of isoform A was observed in several carcinomas and tumor cell lines. In this study, promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A and p16 was investigated in 83 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples from Taiwan and in two HCC cell lines (Hep3B and HepG2). High frequencies (85% and 47%, respectively) of methylation of the CpG island promoters of RASSF1A and p16 were found in the HCC tissues. The methylation of RASSF1A also was detected in Hep3B cells but not in HepG2 cells; p16 was not methylated in either cell line. Methylation status was determined in 12 normal control liver tissues and 10 adjacent nontumor tissues. No methylation was found in normal liver control tissues for both RASSF1A and p16; methylation was detected in one of 10 and seven of 10 adjacent nontumor tissue sampless for p16 and RASSF1A, respectively, in subjects with positive tumors. These data indicate that aberrant methylation of the CpG island promoters of both genes is a frequent occurrence in hepatocarcinogenesis. The high frequency of RASSF1A methylation in adjacent tissues suggests that this may be an early event. The relationship between methylation status and clinical parameters and tumor markers, including DNA damage resulting from aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)), an environmental carcinogen, and p53 status, also was analyzed. A statistically significant association was found between RASSF1A methylation status and the level of AFB(1)-DNA adducts in tumor tissues. No association was found between methylation status and p53 status. These results suggest the hypothesis that exposure to environmental carcinogens may be involved in altered methylation of genes involved in cancer development.",

Methods: A d-PCR-PAGE-laser scanning technique was used to define amplifications of c-myc oncogene. Alternations of MTS1/p16 gene exon1 and exon2 were analysed by PCR and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) silver stain method. HBV-DNA was assayed by PCR. Results: (1)The positive rates of c-myc gene amplification of HCCs and their paired non-cancerous liver tissues were 44.83% (13/29) and 51.72% (15/29). The discrepancies between them were not significant (P>0.05), but they were both significantly higher than that of cirrhotic liver tissues (8.33%, 1/12, P<0.05). (2)A total of 3 homozygous deletions and no mutations of MTS1/p16 gene exon1 and exon2 in HCCs were found in the subset of HCCs.

Moreover, the HBV-DNA positive rates increased according to the development of liver lesions (b=0.3986, P<0.001). Conclusions: (1)C-myc gene amplification and HBV infection are closely related to the development and progression in a subset of HCCs. However, c-myc gene amplification does not correlate with the HBV infection in HCCs. (2)The homozygous deletions and mutations of MTS1/p16 gene are infrequently encountered in the subset of HCCs.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Allelic loss at chromosome 4q21-23 occurs frequently in human hepatocellular carcinoma, and the putative tumor suppressor gene (TSG) has not yet been identified. We studied the Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1) gene as a potential candidate TSG in this region. Experimental design: The expression level of FAP-1 RNA in hepatocellular carcinomas was evaluated by RNase protection and quantitative PCR. Sodium bisulfite modification and subsequent single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequence analyses were used to assay the methylation of CpGs at FAP-1 promoter. Direct sequencing of the FAP-1 coding region was conducted for detecting the genetic mutations. Two common single nucleotide polymorphisms of FAP-1 were selected for evaluating their association with the hepatocellular carcinoma trait in sporadic and familial hepatocellular carcinomas. Moreover, the functional effect of FAP-1 on cellular proliferation has been evaluated by small interfering RNA approach. Results: Around 50% of hepatocellular carcinomas showed significantly decreased expression of FAP-1 compared with the corresponding nontumorous liver tissues. In most cases, the RNA level was well correlated with the methylation status of promoter CpGs, suggesting that the promoter methylation may contribute to the down-regulation. Several genetic mutations of FAP-1 have been identified in hepatocellular carcinomas. The G/G genotype of FAP-1 cSNP6304 was significantly associated with the increased risk of multiplex familial hepatocellular carcinomas (odds ratio, 2.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.01). Finally, knockdown expression of FAP-1 was shown to enhance the cellular proliferation in PLC5 cells. Conclusions: FAP-1 could be inactivated during hepatocarcinogenesis, mainly attributed by allelic loss and promoter methylation. The genetic mutations and polymorphisms may also confront with the higher hepatocellular carcinoma risk. These results first suggested FAP-1 as a putative TSG in hepatocarcinogenesis.",

Methods: Twenty-five HCC tumor samples with corresponding non-tumor liver tissue specimens were examined for p16 gene alterations. The identification of deletion of exon 1 and exon 2 in p16 gene was performed using comparative multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The point mutation of exon 2 in p16 gene was investigated by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and the status of p16 gene methylation was screened using a PCR based methylation analysis. 35 parafin-embedded specimens of HCC with corresponding non-tumor liver tissues, including the 25 cases described above for screening p16 gene alterations, were investigated for p16 protein expression using immunohistochemical analysis. Results: Among 25 cases, 2 homozygous deletions and 1 hemizygous deletion were found in HCC samples. No point mutation was identified in the remaining 22 tumor samples without p16 gene deletions. Hypermethylation was detected in 24% (6/25) of tumor samples. However, the corresponding non-tumor liver tissue specimens were always unmethylated at the p16 locus. Loss of p16 protein expression occurred in 16 of 35 (45.7%) tumor samples, and all the non-tumor liver tissue specimens showed positive p16 staining. For the 25 cases examined for p16 gene alterations, the loss of p16 protein expression was observed in all tumors with p16 gene alterations and also in 3 tumors without p16 gene alterations. Conclusion: Inactivation of the p16 gene may play an important role in the genesis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Using methylation-specific PCR, we demonstrated for the first time p15 promoter methylation in 64% of tumors and 25% (4 of 16) of patients' plasma and serum samples. Concurrent p15 and p16 methylation was shown in 48% of tumors, and p15/p16 methylation was detected in the plasma/serum of 92% (11 of 12) of patients. Of note, 75% of 12 patients with concurrent tumor methylation developed clinical metastasis/recurrence (P = 0.027). In buffy coat samples, p15 methylation was detected in all eight patients with tumor p15 methylation, suggesting the presence of circulating tumor cells. None of the control samples were methylation positive. Our data underscore the important role(s) of p15 and p16 methylation in hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression. Among 92% (23 of 25) of patients with tumor p15/p16 methylation, circulating tumor DNA and HCC cells were detected in the peripheral blood of 87% (20 of 23) of patients. The combination of these epigenetic markers may prove valuable for noninvasive HCC diagnosis and disease monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Vinyl chloride (VC) is a know animal and human carcinogen associated with liver angiosarcomas (LAS) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In VC-associated LAS mutations of the K- ras -2 gene have been reported; however, no data about the prevalence of such mutations in VC associated HCCs are available. Recent data indicate K- ras -2 mutations induce P16 methylation accompanied by inactivation of the p16 gene. The presence of K- ras -2 mutations was analysed in tissue from 18 patients with VC associated HCCs. As a control group, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma due to hepatitis B (n = 7), hepatitis C (n = 5) and alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n = 8) was used. The specific mutations were determined by direct sequencing of codon 12 and 13 of the K- ras -2 gene in carcinomatous and adjacent non-neoplastic liver tissue after microdissection. The status of p16 was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), microsatellite analysis, DNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining. All patients had a documented chronic quantitated exposure to VC (average 8883 ppmy, average duration: 245 months). K- ras -2 mutations were found in 6 of 18 (33%) examined VC-associated HCCs and in 3 cases of adjacent non-neoplastic liver tissue. There were 3 G --> A point mutations in the tumour tissue. All 3 mutations found in non-neoplastic liver from VC-exposed patients were also G --> A point mutations (codon 12- and codon 13-aspartate mutations). Hypermethylation of the 5' CpG island of the p16 gene was found in 13 of 18 examined carcinomas (72%). Of 6 cancers with K- ras -2 mutations, 5 specimens also showed methylated p16. Within the control group, K- ras -2 mutation were found in 3 of 20 (15%) examined HCC. p16 methylation occurred in 11 out of 20 (55%) patients. K- ras -2 mutations and p16 methylation are frequent events in VC associated HCCs. We observed a K- ras -2 mutation pattern characteristic of chloroethylene oxide, a carcinogenic metabolite of VC. Our results strongly suggest that K- ras -2 mutations play an important role in the pathogenesis of VC-associated HCC.",

However, the clinical significance of and risk factors for early massive recurrence after RFA-a dreadful event limiting further curative treatment-have not been fully evaluated. Methods: In total, 438 patients with a single HCC of size ≤3 cm who underwent percutaneous RFA as an initial treatment between 2006 and 2009 were included. Baseline patient characteristics, overall survival, predictive factors, and recurrence after RFA were evaluated. In addition, the incidence, impact on survival, and predictive factors of early massive recurrence, and initial recurrence beyond the Milan criteria within 2 years were also investigated. Results: During the median follow-up of 68.4 months, recurrent HCC was confirmed in 302 (68.9%) patients, with early massive recurrence in 27 patients (6.2%). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 95.4%, 84.7%, and 81.8%, respectively, in patients with no recurrence, 99.6%, 86.4%, and 70.1% in patients with recurrence within the Milan criteria or late recurrence, and 92.6%, 46.5%, and 0.05% in patients with early massive recurrence. Multivariable analysis identified older age, Child-Pugh score B or C, and early massive recurrence as predictive of poor overall survival. A tumor size of ≥2 cm and tumor location adjacent to the colon were independent risk factors predictive of early massive recurrence. Conclusion: Early massive recurrence is independently predictive of poor overall survival after RFA in patients with a single small HCC. Tumors sized ≥2 cm and located adjacent to the colon appear to be independent risk factors for early massive recurrence.",

The expression of p16 mRNA and p16 protein was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: The integration of X gene correlated with the expression loss of p16 mRNA and p16 protein in HCC (P < 0.05). The expression loss rates of p16 protein in HCC and adjacent tissues were 62.9% (22/35) and 40.0% (14/35) with significant difference (P < 0.05). The expression loss of p16 protein in HCC correlated with the differentiation degrees of HCC and the infiltration of tumor cells (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The integration of X gene correlates with the expression loss of p16 protein. The alteration of p16 gene, playing an important role in all stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, correlates with the progress and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Alteration in transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway is one of the main causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The human runt-related transcription factor 3 gene (RUNX3) is an important component of this pathway. RUNX3 locus 1p36 is commonly deleted in a variety of human cancers, including HCC. Therefore, we examined genetic and epigenetic alterations of RUNX3 in human HCC. Methods: Five HCC cell lines and 41 patients with HCC were investigated in this study. We examined the expression of RUNX3 mRNA, methylation status of RUNX3 promoter region, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 1p36, and mutation analysis. These results were compared with clinicopathological data. Results: Promoter hypermethylation was detected in four (80%) of five HCC cell lines and 31 (75.6%) of 41 HCC tissues, confirmed by sequence of bisulfite-treated DNA. LOH was detected in 14 (37.8%) of 37 HCC. By comparison with clinicopathological data, hypermethylation was more common in hepatitis C virus antibody and formation of capsule-positive cases, and decrease of expression was correlated strongly with advanced stage and LOH-detected cases. Conclusion: Hypermethylation and LOH appear to be common mechanisms for inactivation of RUNX3 in HCC. Therefore, RUNX3 may be an important tumor suppressor gene related to hepatocarcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a frequent cause of pediatric liver disease; however, the data on DILI are remarkably limited. Methods: All 69 children hospitalized with DILI between January 2009 and December 2011 were retrospectively studied. Results: A total of 37.7% of the children had medical histories of respiratory infection. The clinical injury patterns were as follows hepatocellular 89.9%, cholestatic 2.9%, and mixed 7.2%. Liver biopsies from 55 children most frequently demonstrated chronic (47.3%) and acute (27.3%) hepatitis. Hypersensitivity features, namely, fever (31.9%), rash (21.7%), and eosinophilia (1.4%), were found. Twenty-four children (34.8%) developed chronic DILI. Antibiotics (26.1%) were the most common Western medicines (WMs) causing DILI, and the major implicated herbs were Ephedra sinica and Polygonum multiflorum. Compared with WM, the children whose injuries were caused by Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) showed a higher level of total bilirubin (1.4 mg/dL vs. 16.6 mg/dL, p=0.004) and a longer prothrombin time (11.8 seconds vs. 17.3 seconds, p=0.012), but they exhibited less chronic DILI (2/15 vs. 18/39, p=0.031). Conclusions: Most cases of DILI in children are caused by antibiotics or CHM used to treat respiratory infection and present with hepatocellular injury. Compared with WM, CHM is more likely to cause severe liver injury, but liver injury caused by CHM is curable.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Human insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) gene contains nine exons and four different promoters (P1-P4). Expression of the gene is elevated in the preneoplastic hepatic foci and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of experimental animals and humans. To gain insight into transcriptional regulation of the gene in HCC, we analyzed the relative usage of the P1-P4 promoters and its correlation with the clinical and pathological characteristics in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Methods: P1-P4 usage levels of the gene in tumorous and matched adjacent nontumorous tissues from 23 HCC patients and 7 normal liver tissues were evaluated using a semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The mutation status of p53 gene in HCC tissues was analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Results: Transcripts from P1 were not detectable in 65.2% HCC tissues, and were expressed at low levels or not expressed in all nontumorous tissues compared with normals, but P2 usage levels showed no differences. P3 and P4 expression was significantly increased in most of HCC and almost all adjacent nontumorous tissues. There was a positive association of expression levels of both P3 and P4 transcripts in HCC tissues with the p53 mutation and presence of tumor embolus of portal vein, and expression of P3 were negatively related to differentiation of HCC. However, expression of both P3 and P4 was not associated with other parameters. Conclusions: Loss of P1 activity and reactivation of P3 and P4 are important characteristics in most of Chinese HCC with HBV infection, and increased IGF-II expression from P3 and P4 may play an active role in early proliferation of precancerous liver cells and hepatocarcinogenesis of these cases. Significant increase in fetal transcripts is associated with the p53 mutation and poor prognosis of the HCC patients and might serve as one of identification parameters of poor HCC prognosis.",

    "Abstract": "Our knowledge about molecular alterations during hepatocarcinogenesis is still fragmentary, due to lack of comprehensive genetic and epigenetic analyses in the same set of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). In this study, we conducted a large-scale analysis, including mutation screening in 50 genes and methylation assays in three genes in 54 pairs of HCCs and their neighboring non-cancerous tissues. All samples were collected from the residents in Southeast China. We found HBV infection and chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis in 83.3% and 98.1% of the cases, respectively. Mutations were identified in 18 out of 54 (33.3%) samples, with p53 alterations in 14 cases and beta-catenin mutations in four tumors. No mutations were identified in the neighboring tissues. Interestingly, 9 out of 14 (64.3%) tumors carrying p53 mutations displayed substitution of serine by arginine at codon 249, a characteristic change believed to be induced by aflatoxin-B1. Furthermore, p53 mutation was significantly associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (P=0.004). The results also revealed aberrant methylation in two or more genes in as high as 90% of tumors and 40% of adjacent tissues. The frequency of RASSF1A hypermethylation was much higher than that of p16INK4a and HAI2 in both HCC and neighboring tissues, indicating that deregulation of RASSF1A may precede the other two genes. These data suggest that aberrant methylation occurs before mutation and is an early event in the development of this set of HCC. Our findings highlight p53 as a prognostic factor of HCC and RASSF1A as a potential target in preventing malignant transformation of hepatocytes.",

Twenty-three cases of surgically resected HBV-associated HCC and 25 fine-needle aspiration biopsy cases of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were studied. The methylation status of the p16(INK4A) promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two-step immunohistochemical staining showed the expression of viral antigens in situ. Tissue HBV-DNA levels were determined by fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR. PCR and the direct sequencing method were used for mutation analysis. In peritumoral tissues (P = 0.025) and CHB samples (P = 0.029), the expression of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) was higher in methylated groups of p16(INK4A) promoter than in unmethylated groups. Other HBV factors including hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen, tissue HBV-DNA levels and HBV x gene mutations had no relation to the methylation status of p16(INK4A) promoter. The data indicate that p16(INK4A) promoter hypermethylation correlated closely with higher HBx expression in the precancerous lesions, suggesting that HBx may play an important role in the early stage of HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis via induction of hypermethylation of p16(INK4A) promoter.",

    "Abstract": "Epigenetic alternation via the promoter hypermethylation of putative tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the epigenetic changes in two candidate tumor suppressor genes, endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) and p16, and their relation to the expression of these two genes in HCC. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) was performed to analyze the promoter methylation status of the EDNRB and p16 genes in tumors and paired non-tumor liver portions of 34 HCC patients. The mRNA expression was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR assay. Hypermethylation of the EDNRB and p16 genes was detected in 29.4% (10/34) and 32.3% (11/34) of HCC patients, respectively. Moreover, the reduction of mRNA expression was correlated to the promoter hypermethylation of the EDNRB and p16 genes. In conclusion, aberrant methylation of EDNRB and p16 genes is highly prevalent in HCC. It suggested that epigenetic alteration of the EDNRB and p16 genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC.",

But in tumors, there was no such significant difference. Other HBV antigens including HBsAg and HBcAg, tissue HBV DNA levels and point mutations of HBV x gene did not show a relationship with the methylation status of p16INK4A gene.

    "Abstract": "WFDC1 is a recently isolated human gene identified as a tumour suppressor gene candidate. It is not known whether alterations in this gene are associated with human cancers. The WFDC1 gene maps in human chromosome 16q24, an area of frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in several tumour types, in particular in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated its role in 46 European HCC by means of the detection of LOH at the WFDC1 locus. We describe here an assay for the detection of loss of heterozygosity at this locus using two dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms identified in WFDC1 introns, with a combined informativity of 86%. LOH was observed in 4/40 informative HCC samples. We further investigated the role of WFDC1 as a tumour suppressor gene candidate in five hepatocellular cell lines and in tumours exhibiting LOH by means of mutation, promoter methylation and gene expression analysis. In HCC samples showing LOH, no mutation of the remaining allele was observed. No significant up or down gene expression was observed in tumour samples comparatively to normal liver and gene expression did not seem related to promoter methylation. These results suggest a minor role, if any, of WFDC1 in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, this approach might be useful for investigating the role of this candidate tumour suppressor gene in other tumour types.",

    "Abstract": "The 14-3-3 sigma gene has been implicated in G2/M cell cycle arrest by p53. Frequent inactivation of the 14-3-3 sigma gene by hypermethylation of CpG islands has recently been reported in human breast carcinoma. The aim of this study was to examine the methylation status of CpG islands of the 14-3-3 sigma gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The methylation status of the 14-3-3 sigma gene was evaluated in four normal liver tissues and 19 paired specimens of carcinoma and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues using bisulfite-single strand conformation polymorphism (bisulfite-SSCP), a combination of sodium bisulfite modification and fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-SSCP. The 14-3-3 sigma protein expression was examined by immunohistochemical staining. Hypermethylation of CpG islands of the 14-3-3 sigma gene was detected in 89% (17/19) of the HCC tissues but not in any of the four normal liver tissues. All of the 14 methylation-positive HCC samples analysed by immunohistochemistry showed loss of 14-3-3 sigma expression, while both of the methylation-negative HCC samples retained the expression, and a significant correlation was found between methylation and loss of expression. Lower levels of methylation were detected in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (6/16 in cirrhotic tissues and 1/3 in chronic hepatitis tissues), but the 14-3-3 sigma expression was retained in all of these tissues. In a methylation-positive HCC cell line, HLE, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC)-induced demethylation of CpG islands led to reactivation of gene expression, indicating that hypermethylation plays a causal role in inactivation of the 14-3-3 sigma gene in HCC. Hypermethylation and the resulting loss of expression of the 14-3-3 sigma gene corresponds to one of the most common abnormalities reported to date in HCC, suggesting their crucial role in the development and/or progression of HCC.",

We extracted DNA from the tumor tissues and peripheral blood plasma or serum of 22 HCC patients. p16 methylation was found in 73% (16 of 22) of HCC tissues using methylation-specific PCR. Among the 16 cases with aberrant methylation in the tumor tissues, similar changes were also detected in the plasma/serum samples of 81% (13 of 16) of the cases. No methylated p16 sequences were detected in the peripheral plasma/serum of the six HCC cases without these changes in the tumor, in 38 patients with chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis, or in 10 healthy control subjects. These results suggest that circulating liver tumor DNA may be detected using tumor-associated DNA methylation changes. Because methylation abnormalities have been found in many other genes and tumor types, this approach may have implications for the noninvasive detection of a wide variety of cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of primary liver cancer and one of the most frequent human malignant neoplasms. Common risk factors of human HCC include chronic hepatitis virus (HBV and HCV) infection, dietary aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) ingestion, chronic alcohol abuse, and cirrhosis associated with genetic liver diseases. Hepatocarcinogenesis is the result of interaction between hereditary and environmental factors. Inheritance determines individual susceptibility to cancer; environment determines which susceptible individuals express cancer. Studies of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis showed that HCC development is a complex polygene and multipathway process; the activation of proto-oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes induced by genetic and epigenetic alterations are core biological processes of hepatocarcinogenesis; RB1, p53, and Wnt pathways are commonly affected in HCCs of different etiologies, which may reflect common pathologic sequence of HCC: chronic liver injury, cirrhosis, atypical hyperplastic nodules, and HCC of early stages. Hepatitis virus infection-associated HCCs have frequent alterations in RB1 pathway, including methylation of p16INK4a and RB1 genes and amplification of Cyclin D1. AFB1 exposure-associated HCCs have frequent alterations in p53 pathway; the G-->T mutation of p53 gene at codon 249 has been identified as a genetic hallmark of HCC caused by AFB1. Alcoholism-associated HCCs have frequent alterations in both RB1 and p53 pathways. The roles of some important genes related to cell apoptosis, DNA repair, drug metabolism, and tumor metastasis in hepatocarcinogenesis had been discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose and experimental design: The human Ras association domain family 1A gene (RASSF1A) is a newly isolated tumor suppressor gene. In this study, we analyzed the methylation status of the promoter region of RASSF1A using bisulfite sequencing and PCR-RFLP in four liver cancer cell lines (Hep3B, HepG(2), SK-HEP-1, and Huh-7) and a cohort of 43 hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and their corresponding nontumor tissue specimens. Results: The methylation of the CpG islands in the RASSF1A promoter was not detected in 4 samples of normal liver tissue or 10 samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal subjects. However, the CpG islands were completely methylated, and transcription of the RASSF1A was silenced in the four cell lines. Treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the expression of RASSF1A in the Hep3B and HepG2 cells. In 41 of 43 (95%) HCC specimens studied, the promoter region of RASSF1A was intensively methylated at its CpG sites. Although heterogeneous methylation was also detected in 16 of the 23 (70%) corresponding nontumorous tissues analyzed, the level of methylation was significantly lower than in the corresponding tumor tissues. Conclusions: HCC has the highest incidence of promoter methylation of RASSF1A among all malignancies yet reported suggesting that hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter of RASSF1A may play an important pathological role in this tumor.",

Methods: A total of 178 patients with early-stage HCC who were initially treated with TACE and showed a CR based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria on one month follow-up computed tomography (CT) were analyzed. Among them, 90 patients underwent scheduled repetition of TACE in the absence of viable tumor on CT. Results: During a median follow-up period of 4.6 years (range: 0.4-8.8 years), mortality was observed in 71 patients (39.9%). The overall recurrence-free and local recurrence-free survival rates at 1 year were 44.4% and 56.2%. In the multivariable model, scheduled repetition of TACE was an independent factor associated with survival (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.56 [0.34-0.93], P=0.025). When stratified using Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage, scheduled repetition of TACE was associated with a favorable survival rate in BCLC stage A patients, but not in BCLC 0 patients. Conclusions: Scheduled repetition of TACE was associated with better survival for early-stage HCC patients showing a CR after initial TACE, especially in BCLC stage A patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human tumors in Asia and Africa. The molecular genetic changes involving both protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are known to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, but the roles of the known tumor suppressor genes in hepatocarcinogenesis are not fully elucidated. In this study, the authors analyzed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of known tumor suppressor genes in HCC and evaluated the relationship between LOH of tumor suppressor genes and clinicopathologic features. Methods: The authors assessed the LOH of the 10 known tumor suppressor genes (VHL, APC, EXT1, WT1, Rb1, p53, BRCA1, nm23, DPC4, and DCC) with microsatellite markers in 29 consecutively resected HCC specimens. Results: The authors found frequent LOH of tumor suppressor genes in HCC. Twenty five of 29 cases (86%) had LOH of tumor suppressor genes and 17 cases (59%) had LOHs involving 2-4 tumor suppressor genes. Among the tumor suppressor genes, frequent LOH was noted in the p53 (66%), Rb1 (33%), EXT1 (33%), and APC (20%) genes. LOH of the p53 gene and multiple LOH of the tumor suppressor genes were more frequent in poorly differentiated HCCs (P = 0.02). Conclusions: The LOH of tumor suppressor genes is frequent in HCCs and LOH of the p53 gene and accumulated LOHs are related to poorly differentiated HCC. Abnormalities of the p53 gene or the accumulated abnormalities of the tumor suppressor genes may play a role in the aggressive progression of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The secreted frizzled-related protein 1 gene (SFRP1) encodes a Wnt/beta-catenin signaling antagonist and frequently is inactivated by promoter methylation in many tumors. However, the role of SFRP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not clear. Therefore, the authors investigated whether methylation of the SFRP1 promoter is common in HCC and whether it may influence SFRP1 expression. Methods: Four HCC cell lines, 54 HCCs, 42 cirrhotic livers, 21 livers with chronic hepatitis, and 15 normal control tissues were analyzed for 1) SFRP1 promoter methylation by using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis and bisulfite sequencing, 2) SFRP1 messenger RNA expression by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and 3) loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by using microsatellite markers flanking the SFRP1 locus. HCC cells were treated with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to determine whether it could restore SFRP1 expression. Results: SFRP1 promoter methylation was observed in 75%, 48.2%, 21.4%, 14.3% and 0% in HCC cell lines, primary HCCs, cirrhotic livers, livers with chronic hepatitis, and normal control tissues, respectively. Methylation of the SFRP1 promoter region in HCCs increased significantly compared with control tissues. All samples with SFRP1 methylation showed down-regulation of SFRP1 expression. Demethylation treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in HCC cells restored SFRP1 expression. Moreover, LOH of markers D8S505 and D8S1722 was found in 25% and 27.6% of the informative samples, respectively. Conclusions: The current results suggested that promoter hypermethylation of SFRP1 is a common event in HCC and plays an important role in the regulation of SFRP1 expression. In addition to methylation-mediated down-regulation of SFRP1, LOH also may play a role.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose and experimental design: Glutathione S-transferases, enzymes that prevent cells from damage mediated by oxidant and electrophilic carcinogens, may be early critical determinants of carcinogenesis. To explore the aberrant promoter CpG island methylation of the GSTP1 gene as a biomarker for screening hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) high risk individuals and for the early detection of HCC, we analyzed its methylation in the tumor and non-tumor tissues and serum samples from 26 patients with HCC, as well as serum from 8 liver cirrhosis patients by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Results: Twenty-three of 26 (88.5%) tumor tissues and 18 of 26 (69%) corresponding non-tumor tissues displayed GSTP1 promoter CpG island hypermethylation. Similarly, GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation was detected for the first time in 16 of 32 (50%) of circulating tumor DNA in the peripheral serum from HCC patients and 4 of 8 (50%) cirrhosis tissues and 3 of 8 (37.5%) corresponding serum DNA from cirrhosis patients. The aberrant methylation of the GSTP1 gene in the serum of patients is in agreement with tumor methylation status (P = 0.004). None of the 12 normal PBMC samples were methylation positive. Conclusions: These data indicate that the epigenetic aberrance of promoter CpG island hypermethylation of the GSTP1 gene may contribute to the hepatopathogenesis of HCC and is a potential valuable biomarker for noninvasive disease monitoring and HCC early diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant promoter methylation is a fundamental mechanism of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. The Ras association domain family 1A gene (RASSF1A) is frequently epigenetically silenced in several types of human solid tumors. In this study, we have investigated the expression and methylation status of the RASSF1A gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In two HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) RASSF1A was inactivated and treatment of these cell lines with a DNA methylation inhibitor reactivated the transcription of RASSF1A. The methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter region was analysed in 26 primary liver tissues including HCC, hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), liver fibrosis, hepatocirrhosis. Out of 15, 14 (93%) HCC were methylated at the RASSF1A CpG island and hypermethylation was independent of hepatitis virus infection. RASSF1A was also methylated in two out of two fibrosis and in three (75%) out of four cirrhosis; the latter carries an increased risk of developing HCC. Additionally, we analysed the methylation status of p16(INK4a) and other cancer-related genes in the same liver tumors. Aberrant methylation in the HCC samples was detected in 71% of samples for p16, 25% for TIMP3, 17% for PTEN, 13% for CDH1, and 7% for RARbeta2. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RASSF1A and p16(INK4a) inactivation by methylation are frequent events in hepatocellular carcinoma, but not in HCA, which is in contrast to HCC without cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, storage diseases, or genetic background. Therefore, this study gives additional evidence against a progression of adenoma to carcinoma in the liver. Thus, RASSF1A hypermethylation could be useful as a marker of malignancy and to distinguish between the distinct forms of highly differentiated liver neoplasm.",

We also determined the relationship of p53 expression with cellular proliferation by immunostaining with monoclonal antibodies to Ki-67. We found significant levels of p53 protein expression in 23.1% of the 117 cases studied, but identified mutations in only 12 cases (10.3%). Only four of the p53-positive cases had mutations in the regions analysed. Six of the cases that displayed mutations at p53 gene were negative for immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) and two cases showed positive immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of the cell. In conclusion, strong IHC reactivity for p53 protein is not an indicator of the presence of p53 gene mutations at exons 4-8 in HCC. Thus, p53 loss of function in HCC should be evaluated both by p53 mutation analysis and p53 protein expression, as both give complementary information about p53 status.",

One case of adjacent non-cancerous liver cirrhosis showed abnormal migration single strand. In the hepatocarcinomas and in the other cases of adjacent non-cancerous liver cirrhosis, no mutation was found. Cloning and sequencing of the amplified abnormal migration single strand DNA revealed that it contained a wild type exon 2 of p15 gene in 345 bp length.

Because the selective expression of p57KIP2 in liver, and because p16CDKN2/MTS1/INK4A has been found altered in many primary tumors, we undertook the present study to determine the presence of alterations in these genes in a group of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Seventeen tumor and normal DNA pairs were analyzed by Southern blot, PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing. Microsatellite markers surrounding the area of the p16 gene was also used. Southern blot analysis did not show allelic losses of the p16 or p57KIP2 genes. In 4 cases, an extra band was observed when hybridizing with the specific p16 cDNA. Overall, 4/17 (24%) cases presented microsatellite alterations at the 9p21-24 region. These results suggest that deletions or point mutations in these genes are not frequent if present at all in HCC, but reveals the existence of microsatellite alterations at the 9p21-24 region in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Arf, a well-established tumor suppressor, is either mutated or downregulated in a wide array of cancers. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is controversial. Conflicting observations have been published regarding its expression in HCC. In this study, we provide clear genetic evidence demonstrating a protective role of p19Arf in hepatocarcinogenesis. Using Ras-induced mouse model, we show that p19Arf deficiency accelerates progression of aggressive HCC in vivo. To investigate the role of p14ARF in human liver cancers, we analyzed its expression in human HCC using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We observe lack of nucleolar p14ARF in 43.02% of human HCC samples and that low expression of p14ARF strongly correlates with the early onset of HCC. Importantly, cirrhotic livers that did not progress to HCC harbor higher expression of the p14ARF protein in hepatocytes compared with that in cirrhotic livers with HCC. These results are significant because they suggest that nucleolar p14ARF can be used as early prognostic marker in chronic liver disease to reliably identify patients with high risk for developing liver cancer. Currently, there is no effective systemic therapy for advanced liver cancer; hence, more efficient patient screening and early detection of HCC would significantly contribute to the eradication of this devastating disease.",

Methods: A total of 124 patients with DILI and 116 patients with PBC treated at Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University from 2005 to 2013 were included. Demographic data (sex and age), biochemical indexes (total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyltransferase), immunological indexes [immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, IgM, antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, and anti-mitochondrial antibodies] and pathological findings were compared in PBC patients, untyped DILI patients and patients with different types of DILI (hepatocellular type, cholestatic type and mixed type). Results: There were significant differences in age and gender distribution between DILI patients and PBC patients. Biochemical indexes (except ALB), immunological indexes, positive rates of autoantibodies (except SMA), and number of cases of patients with different ANA titers (except the group at a titer of 1:10000) significantly differed between DILI patients and PBC patients. Biochemical indexes, immunological indexes, and positive rate of autoantibodies were not quite similar in different types of DILI. PBC was histologically characterized mainly by edematous degeneration of hepatocytes (n = 30), inflammatory cell infiltration around bile ducts (n = 29), and atypical hyperplasia of small bile ducts (n = 28). DILI manifested mainly as fatty degeneration of hepatocytes (n = 15) and spotty necrosis or loss of hepatocytes (n = 14). Conclusion: Although DILI and PBC share some similar laboratory tests (biochemical and immunological indexes) and pathological findings, they also show some distinct characteristics, which are helpful to the differential diagnosis of the two diseases.",

Methods: Patients with confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and progression after/intolerance to sorafenib, Child-Pugh class A liver function, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were randomly assigned 2:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo intravenously every 3 weeks plus BSC for ⩽35 cycles or until confirmed progression/unacceptable toxicity. Outcomes were assessed by ALBI grade. Results: Of 413 patients, at baseline 116 had an ALBI grade 1 score (pembrolizumab, n = 74; placebo, n = 42) and 279 had an ALBI grade 2 score (n = 193; n = 86).

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and severe diseases in the world. Besides the influence of environmental factors, such as viral infection, an increasing number of novel genetic components identified by genome-wide association studies have been associated with predisposition to HCC. Thus, studies focusing on functional variants in these findings are indispensable. In the present study, based on in-silico analysis, we carried out a case-control study in a Chinese population (207 cases and 245 controls) to investigate the association between HCC susceptibility with a 7 base pair (bp) insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs3917) in the 3'UTR of COL1A2. Our results showed that the ins/del + del/del genotype had an odds ratio of 1.76 (95% C.I.=1.03-3.01; P=0.028) for developing HCC compared to the ins/ins genotype. Carriers for the \"del\" allele of rs3917 were associated with a 1.73-fold increased risk for HCC (95% C.I.=1.06-2.84; P(trend)=0.02). Computational modeling suggests that this polymorphism is located in the hsa-let-7 g potential target sequence in the COL1A2 3' untranslated region. Our data suggest that most likely, common genetic changes in COL1A2 may influence HCC risk, at least in part by let-7 g-mediated regulation, which is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. The replication of our studies in other populations will further strengthen our understanding of this association.",

No significant relationships were observed between these two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and onset risk of HCC after adjusting the factors as age, gender, smoking and drinking status in comparison with HBsAg positive controls: hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 (CG + GG vs CC): adjusting OR = 1.10, 95%CI: 0.90 - 1.36; hsa-mir-196-a2 rs11614913 (CC + CT vs TT): adjusting OR = 1.01, 95%CI: 0.81 - 1.25; as well as in comparison with HBsAg negative controls: hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 (CG + GG vs CC): adjusting OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 0.87 - 1.29; hsa-mir-196-a2 rs11614913 (CC + CT vs TT): adjusting OR = 0.94, 95%CI: 0.76 - 1.16. As well, no significant relationships were observed between these two SNPs and onset risk of HCC in the subgroups stratified by age, gender, smoking and drinking status. Conclusion: hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 C→G and hsa-mir-196-a2 rs11614913 T→C may not play an important role in the HCC predisposition among Chinese populations.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that has been proven effective as a single-agent therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma, and there is a strong rationale for investigating its use in combination with other agents. Vitamin K2 is nearly non-toxic to humans and has been shown to inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a combination of sorafenib and vitamin K2 on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Methods: Flow cytometry, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) and nude mouse xenograft assays were used to examine the effects of sorafenib and vitamin K2 on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Western blotting was used to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying these effects. Results: Assays for 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) revealed a strong synergistic growth-inhibitory effect between sorafenib and vitamin K2. Flow cytometry showed an increase in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis after treatment with a combination of these two drugs at low concentrations. Sorafenib-mediated inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation was promoted by vitamin K2, and downregulation of Mcl-1, which is required for sorafenib-induced apoptosis, was observed after combined treatment. Vitamin K2 also attenuated the downregulation of p21 expression induced by sorafenib, which may represent the mechanism by which vitamin K2 promotes the inhibitory effects of sorafenib on cell proliferation. Moreover, the combination of sorafenib and vitamin K2 significantly inhibited the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. Conclusions: Our results determined that combined treatment with sorafenib and vitamin K2 can work synergistically to inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This finding raises the possibility that this combined treatment strategy might be promising as a new therapy against hepatocellular carcinoma, especially for patients with poor liver tolerance.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) classification, especially the identification of LR-3 to 5 lesions with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) probability, is of great significance to treatment strategy determination. We aimed to develop a semi-automatic LI-RADS grading system on multiphase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Patients and methods: An internal data set of 439 patients and external data set of 71 patients with suspected HCC were included and underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. The expert-guided LI-RADS grading system consisted of four deep 3D CNN models including a tumor segmentation model for automatic diameter estimation and three classification models of LI-RADS major features including arterial phase hyper-enhancement (APHE), washout and enhancing capsule. An end-to-end learning system comprising single deep CNN model that directly classified the LI-RADS grade was developed for comparison. Results: On internal testing set, the segmentation model reached a mean dice of 0.84, with the accuracy of mapped diameter intervals as 82.7% (95% CI: 74.4%, 91.7%). The area under the curves (AUCs) were 0.941 (95% CI: 0.914, 0.961), 0.859 (95% CI: 0.823, 0.890) and 0.712 (95% CI: 0.668, 0.754) for APHE, washout and capsule, respectively. The expert-guided system significantly outperformed the end-to-end system with a LI-RADS grading accuracy of 68.3% (95% CI: 60.8%, 76.5%) vs 55.6% (95% CI: 48.8%, 63.0%) (P<0.0001). On external testing set, the accuracy of mapped diameter intervals was 91.5% (95% CI: 81.9%, 100.0%). The AUCs were 0.792 (95% CI: 0.745, 0.833), 0.654 (95% CI: 0.602, 0.703) and 0.658 (95% CI: 0.606, 0.707) for APHE, washout and capsule, respectively. The expert-guided system achieved an overall grading accuracy of 66.2% (95% CI: 58.0%, 75.2%), significantly higher than the end-to-end system of 50.1% (95% CI: 43.1%, 58.1%) (P<0.0001). Conclusion: We developed a semi-automatic step-by-step expert-guided LI-RADS grading system (LR-3 to 5), superior to the conventional end-to-end learning system. This deep learning-based system may improve workflow efficiency for HCC diagnosis in clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes death mainly by disseminated metastasis progression and major challenge of clinical management is to distinguish lethal metastatic stage from indolent stage. It is shown that metastatic progression is closely related to cellular metabolism. But detailed metabolic alterations and molecular mechanisms still kept unclear between subtypes of different lung metastatic potentials. Methods: The current work used NMR-based metabolomics in the study of HCC cells with high malignancy but differed in lung metastatic potentials. Cell extracts and cultured media from MHCC97L and MHCC97H were utilized to reveal metabolic alterations related to metastatic potentials. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify characteristic metabolites which were used subsequently to draw the map of relative biochemical pathways by combining KEGG database. Results: The NMR spectra of both MHCC97L and MHCC97H include various signals from necessary nutritional components and metabolic intermediates. A series of characteristic metabolites were determined from both cell extracts and media. The ability on nutrient uptake varied from cell lines. Most of amino acids decreased in high metastatic cell line, so altered amino acid metabolisms and energy metabolism were revealed in high metastatic MHCC97H cell line. The majority pathways involved six essential amino acids in which the observed branched-chain amino acids together with lysine contributed to biosynthesis or degradation. Basically MHCC97H cell line could induce more active events than that of MHCC97L to progress to high metastasis with certain molecular events. Characteristic metabolites-derived classifiers performed robustly during prediction and confirmed their critical role in supporting metastasis progression. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that NMR-metabolomics analyses of cells are able to understand metastatic characteristics accountable for biological properties. The proposed characteristic metabolites will help to understand HCC metastatic characterizations and may be filtered as potential biomarkers.",

    "Abstract": "Deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is linked to a broad range of cancers, stressing the necessity of studying their regulatory pathways. We and others demonstrated previously that c-Cbl is necessary for the lysosomal degradation of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular B1 (EphB1) carcinoma and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) RTKs. Moreover, the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was shown to modulate c-Cbl-dependent EGFR degradation. We therefore investigated the involvement of PTEN in EphB1 signaling and degradation. We used PTEN mutants, PTEN, and NHERF1 small interfering RNA in CHO-EphB1 and SW480 cells endogenously expressing EphB1 to delineate EphB1-PTEN interactions. PTEN was constitutively associated with c-Cbl, protecting it from degradation. EphB1 stimulation triggered ∼50% serine-threonine PTEN dephosphorylation and PTEN-Cbl complex disruption, a process requiring PTEN protein phosphatase activity. Both proteins independently translocated to EphB1, with PTEN in association with the scaffold protein NHERF1. Biologically, PTEN lipid phosphatase activity impairs EphB1-dependent cell adhesion and chemotaxis. This study demonstrates for the first time in mammalian cells that the Eph receptor and PTEN associate and influence their signaling. Moreover, it contributes to the emerging concept that PTEN regulates expression of RTKs through modulation of their degradation. Finally, it reveals a new role for PTEN protein phosphatase activity involved in this process.",

    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated in varying fractions of almost all tumor types studied. The rate of mutations and the mutational spectrum in some tumors are specific for environmental mutagens assumed to be involved in the carcinogenic process. Thus, hepatocellular carcinomas supposedly induced by aflatoxin exposure often contain a specific point mutation in codon 249, and in lung cancers of miners with heavy radon exposure, another specific point mutation in codon 249 suggestive of an alpha-particle-specific mutation has been shown. The interpretation of studies linking the mutational spectrum with specific environmental exposures is complicated by the multifactorial or unknown genesis of most tumors. However, people given injections of the X-ray contrast medium Thorotrast (Th) in the past have experienced an enormous risk of liver tumors, and virtually all of these are supposedly induced by alpha-particles from the decay of 232Th. The examination of these tumors may provide evidence as to whether specific p53 point mutations are relevant in alpha-particle carcinogenesis. Therefore, we collected paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed archival tissues from 18 hepatocellular carcinomas, 9 cholangiocarcinomas, and 9 hepatic angiosarcomas from Thorotrast-exposed patients. The tissues were analyzed for p53 protein expression by immunohistochemical staining by using the mAb DO-7 and for mutations of exons 5-8 by PCR and constant denaturant gel electrophoresis. G --> T transversions of the third base of codon 249 of the p53 gene were specifically screened for by restriction enzymes. No high score for p53 protein expression (i.e., positive staining of >20% of examined cells) was observed; lower scores were seen in 5 of 18 (28%) hepatocellular carcinomas, 1 of 9 (11%) cholangiocarcinomas, and 0 of 8 (0%) hepatic angiosarcomas. Only one p53 mutation, a heterozygous T --> G transversion of the first base codon 176, occurred in a hepatocellular carcinoma. The rate of p53 point mutations in alpha-particle-induced liver tumors seems to be lower than in European hepatocellular carcinomas in general. The study does not exclude the possibility that alpha-particle carcinogenesis may involve inactivation of p53 by gross deletions of the gene, but it speaks against the proposed specificity of point mutations of codon 249 in cancer supposedly induced by alpha-particles from radon progeny.",

    "Abstract": "A 63-year-old man with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and coagulopathy was diagnosed with a sinus venosus atrial septal defect (ASD) and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) of the right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV). Transcatheter repair by positioning a stent graft in the superior vena cava was planned. Based on three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of gated cardiac CTA, a 28 mm × 7 cm Endurant II® aortic extension stent graft (Medtronic, MN) was chosen. A 3D model printed from the CTA was used to simulate device deployment, demonstrating successful exclusion of the sinus venosus ASD with return of the RUPV to the left atrium (LA). Post simulation, the 3D model was used for informed consent. The patient was then taken to the hybrid operating room. On-table cone beam CT was performed and registered with the CTA images. This enabled overlay of 3D regions of interest to live 2D fluoroscopy. The stent graft was then deployed using 3D regions of interest for guidance. Hemodynamics and angiography demonstrated successful exclusion of the sinus venosus ASD and unobstructed return of RUPV to the LA. This is the first report of comprehensive use of contemporary imaging for planning, simulation, patient consent, and procedural guidance for patient-centered complex structural intervention in repair of sinus venosus ASD with PAPVR. We propose this as a process model for continued innovation in structural interventions.",

    "Abstract": "For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with macrovascular invasion (MaVI), hepatectomy and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) remain the main treatment options in Asia. However, which could achieve better survivals remains controversial. In present study, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the survival benefits and safety of hepatectomy versus TACE in HCC patients with MaVI. The PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for eligible studies. There were no prospective studies identified. 8 retrospective studies from Asia with 1683 patients met our inclusion criteria were included in meta-analysis. The overall survival (OS) is higher in hepatectomy group than TACE group (HR=1.61, 95%CI=1.23-2.10, p=0.0005). Hepatectomy was superior over TACE in 1-year (OR=2.27, 95%CI=1.26-4.08, p=0.006) and 3-year (OR=3.04, 95%CI=2.17-4.26, p<0.00001) respectively, but not in 5-year (OR=7.34, 95%CI=0.78-68.16, p=0.08) survival rate. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that hepatectomy was superior over TACE for patients with PVTT (HR=1.50, 95%CI=1.14-1.98, p=0.004), but not for patients with HVTT/IVC (HR=2.39, 95%CI=0.88-6.49, p=0.09). There was not significantly difference between two groups in peri-operative mortality. Our results indicated that, compared to TACE, hepatectomy might be a better treatment option for resectable HCC patients with MaVI. Being lack of high-quality studies, more well-designed multi-center randomized trials are needed to confirm our finding.",

    "Abstract": "Chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and histone proteins form a highly condensed structure known as chromatin. Chromatin remodeling proteins regulate deoxyribonucleic acid transcription, synthesis and repair by changing nucleosomal composition in an adenosine triphosphate-dependent manner and mediate access of deoxyribonucleic acid-binding proteins to deoxyribonucleic acid double strands. Recently, large-scale genome sequencing studies identified somatic mutations in genes encoding chromatin remodeling proteins in a variety of human solid cancers. Notably, inactivating mutations in genes encoding the catalytic and regulatory subunits of the switch/sucrose non-fermenting chromatin remodeling complex have been detected in several solid cancers: sucrose non-fermenting/switch/sucrose non-fermenting-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily b, member 1/Brahma-related gene 1-associated factor 47/integrase interactor 1 mutations in rhabdoid tumors; AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1 A/Brahma-related gene 1-associated factor 250a mutations in ovarian clear cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric adenocarcinoma; polybromo 1/Brahma-related gene 1-associated factor 180 mutations in renal clear cell carcinoma; Brahma-related gene 1/switch/sucrose non-fermenting-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4 mutations in non-small-cell lung carcinoma and AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 2/Brahma-related gene 1-associated factor 200 mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma and malignant melanoma. This suggests that the switch/sucrose non-fermenting complex has a tumor-suppressive function, and that switch/sucrose non-fermenting gene deficiencies may affect the properties of cancer cells, which could be of value for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) alone and combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in high risk locations. Materials and methods: We performed PEI for HCCs in RFA-high risk locations, either alone or in combination with RFA. There were 20 HCCs (1.7 ± 0.9 cm) in 20 patients (PEI group: n = 12; PEI + RFA group: n = 8). We evaluated technical success, local tumor progression and complications in both groups. Results: Technical success was achieved in all HCCs in both groups. During follow-up, local tumor progression was found in 41.7% (5/12) in the PEI group, whereas 12.5% (1/8) for the PEI + RFA group (p = 0.32). Bile duct dilatation was the most common complication, especially when the tumors were in periportal locations; 55% (5/9) in the PEI group and 50% (2/4) in the PEI + RFA group (p = 1.00). One patient in the PEI group developed severe biliary stricture and upstream dilatation that resulted in atrophy of the left hepatic lobe. One patient treated with PEI + RFA developed cholangitis and an abscess. Conclusion: Combined PEI and RFA treatment has a tendency to be more effective than PEI alone for managing HCCs in high risk locations, although the difference is not statistically significant. Even though PEI is generally accepted as a safe procedure, it may cause major biliary complications for managing HCCs adjacent to the portal vein.",

    "Abstract": "Maspin is a Class II tumor suppressor protein and plays a role in tumor growth by inhibiting cellular invasion and motility. It is a member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors and has been shown to reduce angiogenesis. Maspin gene expression can be upregulated by the tumor suppressor p53. We tested 7 p53-related proteins of the p63 and p73 families for their ability to induce maspin expression. The p63 splice form TAp63gamma can substitute for p53 in activating the maspin promoter. TAp63gamma activates the promoter through the same consensus site as p53. In the DLD-1 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, harboring a tet-off regulated transgene, induction of TAp63gamma leads to an upregulation of maspin mRNA from the chromosomal gene. With a short lag phase also maspin protein levels are elevated after induced TAp63gamma expression. To assess a potential function of p63-dependent maspin upregulation in tumors we followed expression of p53, p63 and maspin by immunohistochemistry in hepatocellular carcinomas. Two types of tumors with wild-type or mutant p53 were assayed. Interestingly, the majority of tumors expressing only a mutated and inactive p53 protein nonetheless stain positive for maspin, whereas these tumors were positive for p63 protein expression. In summary, we show that TAp63gamma can substitute for p53 in transcriptional activation of the maspin tumor suppressor gene. TAp63gamma employs the same DNA recognition site for this activation as p53. We observe expression patterns of p53, p63 and maspin proteins in tumor tissue that may indicate also a function of maspin induction by p63 in tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Early diagnosis plays an important role in the improvement of HCC prognosis. Methods: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of HCC DNA methylation and gene expression datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), to identify a prognostic signature for HCC diagnosis and survival prediction. First, we identified differential methylation CpG (dmCpG) sites in HCC samples and compared them with those in adjacent normal liver tissues; this was followed by univariate analysis and Sure Independence Screening (SIS) in the training set. The robustness of the identified prognostic signature was evaluated using the testing set. To explore the biological processes involved in HCC progression, we also performed functional enrichment analysis for overlapping genes between genes containing dmCpG sites (DMGs) and differential expression genes (DEGs) in HCC patients, using data from the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Results: As a result, we identified five CpG sites that were significantly associated with HCC survival through univariate analysis and SIS. Univariate analysis of clinical characteristics identified age and risk factors (including alcohol consumption and smoking) as independent factors that indicated HCC survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that the integrated prognostic signature (weighted combination of the five CpG sites) that took age and risk factors into consideration resulted in more accurate survival prediction. Conclusions: This study provides a novel signature for predicting HCC survival, and should be helpful for early HCC diagnosis and personalized treatment.",

    "Abstract": "In the present study we present evidence for the critical role of Sp1 in the mechanism of transactivation of the human cell cycle inhibitor p21(WAF1/Cip1) (p21) gene promoter by the tumor suppressor p53 protein. We found that the distal p53-binding site of the p21 promoter acts as an enhancer on the homologous or heterologous promoters in hepatoma HepG2 cells. In transfection experiments, p53 transactivated the p21 promoter in HaCaT cells that express Sp1 but have a mutated p53 form. In contrast, p53 could not transactivate the p21 promoter in the Drosophila embryo-derived Schneider's SL2 cells that lack endogenous Sp1 or related factors. Cotransfection of SL2 cells with p53 and Sp1 resulted in a synergistic transactivation of the p21 promoter. Synergistic transactivation was greatly decreased in SL2 cells and HaCaT cells by mutations in either the p53-binding site or in the -82/-77 Sp1-binding site indicating functional cooperation between Sp1 and p53 in the transactivation of the p21 promoter. Synergistic transactivation was also decreased by mutations in the transactivation domain of p53. Physical interactions between Sp1 and p53 proteins were established by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. By using deletion mutants we found that the DNA binding domain of Sp1 is required for its physical interaction with p53. In conclusion, Sp1 must play a critical role in regulating important biological processes controlled by p53 via p21 gene activation such as DNA repair, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.",

    "Abstract": "Currently, drug metabolization and toxicity studies rely on the use of primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines, which both have conceivable limitations. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) are an alternative and valuable source of hepatocytes that can overcome these limitations. EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), a transcriptional repressor of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), may play an important role in hepatocyte development, but its role during in vitro hPSC-HLC differentiation has not yet been assessed. We here demonstrate dynamic regulation of EZH2 during hepatic differentiation of hPSC. To enhance EZH2 expression, we inducibly overexpressed EZH2 between d0 and d8, demonstrating a significant improvement in definitive endoderm formation, and improved generation of HLCs. Despite induction of EZH2 overexpression until d8, EZH2 transcript and protein levels decreased from d4 onwards, which might be caused by expression of microRNAs predicted to inhibit EZH2 expression. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that EZH2 plays a role in endoderm formation and hepatocyte differentiation, but its expression is tightly post-transcriptionally regulated during this process.",

    "Abstract": "A mixed effect model describing median overall survival (mOS) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) treated with antiangiogenic therapy (AAT) was developed from literature data. Data were extracted from 59 studies, representing 4,813 patients. The final model included estimates of mOS after AAT (8.5 months) or placebo (7.1 months) administration. The mOS increased 21% when the AAT was sorafenib (SOR) or 42% when locoregional therapy was coadministered. The mOS decreased when patients received prior systemic therapy (↓7%) or concomitant chemotherapy (↓4%) or the percentage of patients with hepatitis B increased (↓∼0.4%/%). Clinical trial simulations of a phase II comparative trial predicted an mOS ratio (placebo:AAT) of 0.687 or 0.831, with a 65% or 22% probability of demonstrating superiority, for SOR or other AATs, respectively. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the simulated median mOS ratio for non-SOR AATs was similar to the 95% CI of the hazard ratio (HR) observed in the trial.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Liver fibrosis index FIB-4 has been reported to be linked with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis, but the results were not consistent. This study aimed to synthetically explore the relationship between FIB-4 and clinical outcomes of HCC. Methods: A number of online databases were searched for relevant articles published before March 1, 2018. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess the prognostic value of the FIB-4 index in patients with HCC using Stata SE 12.0. Results: Eight articles (including 10 cohort studies) with 3485 HCC patients were finally included for analysis. The pooled results showed that FIB-4 index was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) for patients with HCC (HR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.41-2.07, P <.001). And HCC patients with higher FIB-4 score were at significantly greater risk of recurrence 1.53 (95% CI: 1.29-1.78, P <.001). Subgroup analysis based on the treatment, stage and analysis type also confirmed the prognostic values of the FIB-4 score for OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in HCC. Conclusions: FIB-4 index might be a useful predictive marker in patients with HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Phase II trials found that tegafur-uracil (UFT) is an effective drug in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while preclinical data suggested that its combination with sorafenib may have a promising activity. Our Phase II randomized trial aimed to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib plus UFT vs sorafenib in advanced HCC. Methods: Patients with advanced HCC, with no prior systemic therapy, were randomized to receive either UFT at 125 mg/m2 twice daily for 4 out of 5 weeks plus sorafenib at 400 mg twice daily (arm 1) or single agent sorafenib at 400 mg twice daily (arm 2). Primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Results: Between March 2012 and March 2014, 76 eligible patients - out of 143 preplanned - were randomized. The study was terminated early because of futility. This is the final analysis of the study, after a median follow-up of 10.2 months and death of 86% of randomized patients (n=64). Median TTP was 7.5 months and 8.2 months in arms 1 and 2 respectively (HR: 1.07; 95% CI, 0.52-2.22; P=0.855), while the median overall survival was 8.2 months and 10.5 months respectively (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.90-2.76, P=0.112). Nine patients (25%) in the combination arm discontinued treatment because of toxicity vs eight patients (21.1%) in the sorafenib monotherapy arm (P=0.899). Conclusion: In patients with advanced HCC, adding UFT to sorafenib is feasible, but it did not improve efficacy outcome over sorafenib monotherapy.",

Methylation-specific PCR was used to analyze the methylation status of the FHIT gene. Results: After DNMT3b siRNA transfection, the expression of DNMT3b was inhibited in SMMC-7721 cells, and the expression of FHIT was significantly higher than that in the control group. There was no significant difference in methylation status between the DNMT3b siRNA transfected cells and control cells. Conclusion: DNMT3b may play an important role in regulation of FHIT expression in hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells, but not through methylation of the FHIT promoter.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Dried flower bud of Syzygium aromaticum (clove) is rich in eugenol, an antioxidant and antiinflammatory compound that can protect liver against injury. Clove, besides eugenol, also contains other pharmacologically active phytochemicals such as β-sitosterol and ascorbic acid. This study reports the effect of eugenol-rich fraction (ERF) of clove on liver cirrhosis induced by thioacetamide. Methods: Cirrhosis of the liver, which predisposes to hepatocellular carcinoma, was induced by administering thioacetamide (0.03%) in drinking water for 16 weeks. Cirrhotic animals were divided into two groups; the treated group was administered ERF for 9 weeks, one week after discontinuation of thioacetamide, while the other group received normal saline for a similar duration of time. Results: The treatment with ERF, as determined by histopathology and through a battery of biochemical markers of hepatic injury, oxidative stress and drug metabolizing enzymes, significantly ameliorated the signs of liver cirrhosis. It lowered the elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase and other biochemical changes in liver cirrhosis. Histopathology of the liver corroborated the effect of ERF with biochemical findings. ERF treatment further inhibited cell proliferation, as demonstrated by reduced [(3)H]-thymidine uptake. Conclusions: Data provide evidence supporting the protective action of ERF on liver cirrhosis. The study assumes significance because cirrhosis predisposes the liver to cancer, which is characterized by abnormal cell proliferation. ERF in this study is reported to inhibit hepatic cell proliferation and at the same time decrease oxidative stress, which might be the mechanism of protection against liver cirrhosis.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: PTEN is a dual lipid/protein phosphatase, downregulated in steatotic livers with obesity or HCV infection. Liver-specific PTEN knockout (LPTEN KO) mice develop steatosis, inflammation/fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with aging, but surprisingly also enhanced glucose tolerance. This study aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which hepatic PTEN deficiency improves glucose tolerance, while promoting fatty liver diseases. Methods: Control and LPTEN KO mice underwent glucose/pyruvate tolerance tests and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps. Body fat distribution was assessed by EchoMRI, CT-scan and dissection analyses. Primary/cultured hepatocytes and insulin-sensitive tissues were analysed ex vivo. Results: PTEN deficiency in hepatocytes led to steatosis through increased fatty acid (FA) uptake and de novo lipogenesis. Although LPTEN KO mice exhibited hepatic steatosis, they displayed increased skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, as assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps. Surprisingly, white adipose tissue (WAT) depots were also drastically reduced. Analyses of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism further indicated that FA synthesis/esterification was decreased in WAT. In addition, Ucp1 expression and multilocular lipid droplet structures were observed in this tissue, indicating the presence of beige adipocytes. Consistent with a liver to muscle/adipocyte crosstalk, the expression of liver-derived circulating factors, known to impact on muscle insulin sensitivity and WAT homeostasis (e.g. FGF21), was modulated in LPTEN KO mice. Conclusions: Although steatosis develops in LPTEN KO mice, PTEN deficiency in hepatocytes promotes a crosstalk between liver and muscle, as well as adipose tissue, resulting in enhanced insulin sensitivity, improved glucose tolerance and decreased adiposity.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The p53 family member p73 displays significant homology to p53, but data from primary tumors demonstrating increased expression levels of p73 in the absence of any gene mutations argue against a classical tumor suppressor function. A detailed analysis of the p73 protein in tumor tissues has revealed expression of two classes of p73 isoforms. Whereas the proapoptotic, full-length, transactivation-competent p73 protein (TA-p73) has a putative tumor suppressor activity similar to p53, the antiapoptotic, NH(2)-terminally truncated, transactivation-deficient p73 protein (DeltaTA-p73) has been shown to possess oncogenic activity. The oncogenic proteins can be generated by the following two different mechanisms: (a) aberrant splicing (p73Deltaex2, p73Deltaex2/3, DeltaN'-p73) and (b) alternative promoter usage of a second intronic promoter (DeltaN-p73). The purpose of our study was to elucidate the origin of DeltaTA-p73 isoforms in hepatocellular carcinomas. Experimental design: We analyzed the underlying mechanisms of p73 overexpression in cancer cells by quantification of p73 transcripts from 10 hepatocellular carcinoma patients using isoform-specific real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Results: Our data demonstrate that only aberrantly spliced DeltaTA-p73 transcripts from the TA promoter show significantly increased expression levels in the tumor whereas the DeltaN-p73 transcript generated from the second promoter is not significantly up-regulated. Conclusions: Although we only analyzed 10 patient samples the results strongly suggest that the elevated activity of the first promoter (TA promoter) accounts for high-level expression of both full-length TA-p73 and aberrantly spliced DeltaTA-p73 isoforms in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues.",

    "Abstract": "The expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in ten human cell lines (nine cancers and one normal) was studied using reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Using P53U and P53D primers for amplifying a 371-base pair (bp) target fragment spanning exons 7-10 of p53 cDNA, normal-sized PCR products were amplified from 9 cell lines but not from the Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line. An additional larger band (504 bp) was observed for the Molt-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Employing P531 and P53D primers which flank a 76-bp p53 cDNA fragment, 76 bp as well as 209 bp products were generated by PCR of Molt-4 cDNA. Direct sequencing of the 504 bp and 209 bp bands confirmed the presence of a 133 bp insertion between exons 9 and 10 in the aberrant transcript. This insertion was homologous to a 130-bp sequence within the wild-type p53 intron 9, except for 2 point mutations and 3 base insertions. Sequencing of P53U/P53D PCR products of Molt-4 genomic DNA revealed an 8 bp deletion just downstream to the 133 bp insertion, creating a novel donor splicing site within intron 9. This site, coupled with an inherent acceptor splicing site just upstream to the 133 bp insertion, suggests that the 133 bp stretch represents an alternative exon. The occurrence of a termination signal within this alternative transcript is predicted to culminate in a truncated p53 translational product. The sequences of the 371 bp PCR products of Molt-4, HT-1080, SiHa, CaSki, HeLa and MRC-5 cell lines corresponded with the wild-type p53 cDNA. G-->T transversions at the third base of codon 249 of p53 were detected in Mahlavu and PLC/PRF/5 HCC lines, while a TAC to CAC mutation at codon 234 was observed in an allele of the Raji Burkitt lymphoma line.",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the molecular basis for low expression and activity of CYP2D6 associated with the CYP2D6*41 allele in about 10-15% of Caucasians with intermediate metabolizer phenotype. With respect to two previously described polymorphisms in the promoter (-1584C>G) and in intron 6 (2988G>A; c.985+39G>A), the three most frequent functional alleles have the distinct haplotypes 2D6*1[CG], 2D6*2[GG] and 2D6*41[CA], respectively. Reporter gene analyses in transiently transfected HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cells did not indicate changes in transcription rate by these polymorphisms. By reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of liver RNA of genotyped patients, however, we discovered that the 2988G>A change was associated with increased levels of a nonfunctional splice variant lacking exon 6. Quantification by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography revealed up to 7.3-fold increased levels of the splice variant and up to 2.9-fold less functional transcript in carriers of 2D6*41, in good concordance with concomitant changes in immunoquantified CYP2D6 protein. Recombinant expression of the entire genomic sequence coding for 2D6*41, 2D6*2 and 2D6*1 alleles but lacking the upstream region in COS-1 and Huh7 cell lines resulted in two-fold to five-fold reduced levels of CYP2D6 mRNA containing exon 6, apoprotein and enzyme activity of 2D6*41. These experiments establish the causal relationship between the intron 6 single-nucleotide polymorphism 2988G>A and the low expression phenotype associated with allele 2D6*41. These data improve the CYP2D6 genotype-phenotype relationship and they demonstrate that major phenotype changes occurring in large population subgroups can be caused by intronic polymorphisms outside of splice site consensus sequences.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of human tumors, which is characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. AKT1 transcriptional activity is implicated in HCC initiation and development. In the present study, the effects of rs2494752 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on AKT1 transcriptional activity in the progression of HCC cells were investigated. A case-control study was analyzed in 1,056 HCC patients and 1,080 healthy individuals using the PCR assay method. Results indicated AKT1 expression levels were up-regulated in HCC tissue compared to adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, a higher frequency of AKT rs2494752 AG and AA genotypes were observed in HCC cases (P=0.0046). Gene polymorphism identified C and T alleles were frequency in HCC patients compared to healthy individuals. Individuals harboring AKT rs2494752 AG/AA genotype had a vital increased susceptibility to HCC in the dominant model (P=0.0028). In addition, AKT1 rs2494752 GG genotype showed an increasing of AKT1 promoter activity determined by the luciferase assay. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that AKT1 rs2494752 GG and C polymorphism was more aggressive than other AKT1 rs2494752 cancer cells. Moreover, AKT1 rs2494752 GG markedly increased rates of response to NCT chemotherapy. Additionally, results revealed that AKT1 rs2494752 GG and C increased the risk factors of HCC. In conclusion, these results indicate that AKT1 rs2494752 polymorphisms may be regarded as a candidate gene in assessing the susceptibility, metastasis and responses to chemotherapy in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Its efficacy in randomised controlled trials was demonstrated in patients with well-preserved liver function and good functional status. In the real-world setting, treatment is often offered to patients outside these criteria. We therefore performed a single-centre real-world cohort study on the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients and methods We identified all patients with hepatocellular carcinoma initiating treatment with sorafenib between January 2015 and January 2018. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) since starting sorafenib. Clinical and demographic variables associated with survival were studied. Results The median OS was 13.4 months (95% CI 8.2-18.6). Multivariable Cox's regression identified worse ECOG performance status (HR 2.21; 95% CI 1.56-3.16; P < 0.0001), Child-Pugh class C (HR 52.4; 95% CI 3.20-859; P = 0.005) and absence of prior locoregional treatment (HR 2.30; 95% CI 1.37-3.86; P = 0.002) to be associated with increased mortality. Conclusions Careful selection of patients for treatment with sorafenib is of paramount importance to optimize outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "This study examined the impact of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the telomerase-associated protein 1 (TEP1) gene on the risk of breast, colorectal, hepatocellular, lung and stomach cancer. A significantly increased stomach cancer risk associated with the GG genotype at rs1760893 (odds ratio (OR)=1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.23-2.20, P=0.004) or CC genotype at rs1713423 (OR=2.40, 95% CI=1.88-3.07, P<0.0001) was observed, compared with their wild-type counterpart. The GG genotype at rs1760893 was also associated with enhanced hepatocellular cancer susceptibility (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.05-2.03, P=0.02). In classification and regression tree analysis, individuals carrying the CC genotype at rs1713423 had 2.69-fold increased risk of stomach cancer (95% CI=2.18-3.32, P<0.0001) compared with the TT and TC genotypes. The current results suggested that genetic variants at TEP1 SNPs rs1760893 and rs1713423 may be associated significantly with increased risk of stomach cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) in combination with peginterferon (PegIFN) therapy in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) shows better effectiveness than NA monotherapy in hepatitis B surface antigen loss, termed \"functional cure,\" based on previous published studies. However, it is not known which strategy is more cost-effective on functional cure. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of first-line monotherapies and combination strategies in HBeAg-positive CHB patients in China from a social perspective. Methods: A Markov model was developed with functional cure and other five states including CHB, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death to assess the cost-effectiveness of seven representative treatment strategies. Entecavir (ETV) monotherapy and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) monotherapy served as comparators, respectively. Results: In the two base-case analysis, compared with ETV, ETV generated the highest costs with $44,210 and the highest quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with 16.78 years. Compared with TDF, treating CHB patients with ETV and NA - PegIFN strategies increased costs by $7639 and $6129, respectively, gaining incremental QALYs by 2.20 years and 1.66 years, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $3472/QALY and $3692/QALY, respectively, which were less than one-time gross domestic product per capita. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the results. Conclusion: Among seven treatment strategies, first-line NA monotherapy may be more cost-effective than combination strategies in HBeAg-positive CHB patients in China.",

    "Abstract": "Cluster of differentiation (CD)133 is considered a molecular marker of cancer stem cells in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, the effect of lidamycin (LDM) on CD133 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7 cells) was evaluated and the potential molecular mechanism was investigated. Flow cytometry analysis, as well as sorting, sphere formation and western-blot assays, were performed in vitro to explore the effects of LDM on CD133 expression. A subcutaneous tumor model in nude mice was used to observe the effects of LDM on tumor volume and CD133 protein in vivo. To investigate the potential underlying molecular mechanism, Notch signaling pathway activity was detected by western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The proportion of CD133+ cells and the expression of CD133 protein were revealed to be downregulated by LDM. Sphere formation of sorted CD133+ cells was suppressed 7 days after LDM treatment. In addition, LDM inhibited tumor volume formed from sorted CD133+ cells and CD133 protein level in vivo. LDM decreased the mRNA level of NOTCH1, Hes1 (Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1) and Hey1 (Hes-related family BHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1) genes; consequently, the protein expression of NOTCH1, Notch intracellular domain, Hes1 and Hey1 was decreased by LDM. Downregulation of the Notch signaling pathway by LDM was enhanced through combination with N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester. In brief, these data suggest that LDM suppresses CD133 expression via the Notch signaling pathway, indicating the potential mechanism of LDM on CD133 and the benefits for further clinical application.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte-specific expression of the alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1AT) gene requires the activities of two liver-enriched transactivators, hepatocyte nuclear factors 1alpha and 4 (HNF-1alpha and HNF-4). The alpha1AT gene maps to a region of human chromosome 14q32.1 that includes a related serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene encoding corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and the chromatin organization of this approximately 130-kb region, as defined by DNase I-hypersensitive sites, has been described. Microcell transfer of human chromosome 14 from fibroblasts to rat hepatoma cells results in activation of alpha1AT and CBG transcription and chromatin reorganization of the entire locus. To assess the roles of HNF-1alpha and HNF-4 in gene activation and chromatin remodeling, we transferred human chromosome 14 from fibroblasts to rat hepatoma cell variants that are deficient in expression of HNF-1alpha and HNF-4. The variant cells failed to activate either alpha1AT or CBG transcription, and chromatin remodeling failed to occur. However, alpha1AT and CBG transcription could be rescued by transfecting the cells with expression plasmids encoding HNF-1alpha or HNF-4. In these transfectants, the chromatin structure of the entire alpha1AT/CBG locus was reorganized to an expressing cell-typical state. Thus, HNF-1alpha and HNF-4 control both chromatin structure and gene activity of two cell-specific genes within the serpin gene cluster at 14q32.1.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determine appropriate indications. Methods: We reviewed outcomes of 300 HCC patients who underwent US-guided percutaneous cryoablation. Results: Overall, 223 tumors (mean diameter 7.2 ± 2.8 cm) in 165 patients were incompletely ablated, while 185 tumors (mean diameter 5.6 ± 0.8 cm, P = 0.0001 vs. incomplete ablation) in 135 patients were completely ablated. Nineteen patients (6.3%) developed serious complications while in hospital, including cryoshock syndrome in six patients, hepatic bleeding in five, stress-induced gastric bleeding in four, liver abscess in one and intestinal fistulas in one. Two patients died because of liver failure. The median follow-up was 36.7 months (range 6-63 months). The local tumor recurrence rate was 31%, and was related to tumor size (P = 0.029) and tumor location (P = 0.037). The mean survival duration of patients with early, intermediate and advanced HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system) was 45.7 ± 3.8, 28.4 ± 1.2 and 17.7 ± 0.6 months, respectively. Conclusions: US-guided percutaneous cryoablation is a relatively safe and effective therapy for selected HCC patients.",

Methods: A total of 3440 HCC patients were retrospectively enrolled into this study, and all of them underwent curative hepatectomy. The clinical and pathological variables together with CA125, AFP serum level were collected at diagnosis and postoperative care stages. A chi-square test was used to compare the differences between variables. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence﻿-free survival (RFS) were measured with the Kaplan-Meier method. To estimate prognostic factors, a multivariate ﻿Cox regression analysis was performed. Results: ﻿Of the 3440 enrolled patients, 409 (11.9%) exhibited elevated preoperative serum CA125 level﻿, ﻿and high preoperative serum CA125 level was significantly associated with younger age, female, higher ALBI grade, higher serum AFP level, blood transfusion, more operative bleeding loss, larger tumor size, multiple tumor, increased macro- or micro-vascular invasion, Edmondson grade III-IV, absence of tumor capsular, satellite nodules, liver cirrhosis, more advanced TNM stages and BCLC stages. HCC patients with high preoperative serum CA125 level usually had a shorter OS rate and experienced a higher probability of recurrence than those with normal preoperative serum level of CA125 (p<0.0001). The multivariate analysis suggested that elevated serum CA125 level serves as an independent predictor of OS and RFS in HCC patients after surgical resection. Conclusion: Elevated preoperative serum CA125 correlated with many malignant characterizations of HCC and served as an independent prognostic factor of OS and RFS.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To determine the impact of transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS) on post liver transplantation (LT) outcomes. Methods: Utilizing the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, we compared patients who underwent LT from 2002 to 2013 who had underwent TIPS to those without TIPS for the management of ascites while on the LT waitlist. The impact of TIPS on 30-d mortality, length of stay (LOS), and need for re-LT were studied. For evaluation of mean differences between baseline characteristics for patients with and without TIPS, we used unpaired t-tests for continuous measures and χ2 tests for categorical measures. We estimated the impact of TIPS on each of the outcome measures. Multivariate analyses were conducted on the study population to explore the effect of TIPS on 30-d mortality post-LT, need for re-LT and LOS. All covariates were included in logistic regression analysis. Results: We included adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who underwent LT from May 2002 to September 2013. Only those undergoing TIPS after listing and before liver transplant were included in the TIPS group. We excluded patients with variceal bleeding within two weeks of listing for LT and those listed for acute liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of 114770 LT in the UNOS database, 32783 (28.5%) met inclusion criteria. Of these 1366 (4.2%) had TIPS between the time of listing and LT. We found that TIPS increased the days on waitlist (408 ± 553 d) as compared to those without TIPS (183 ± 330 d), P < 0.001. Multivariate analysis showed that TIPS had no effect on 30-d post LT mortality (OR = 1.26; 95%CI: 0.91-1.76) and re-LT (OR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.36-1.05). Pre-transplant hepatic encephalopathy added 3.46 d (95%CI: 2.37-4.55, P < 0.001), followed by 2.16 d (95%CI: 0.92-3.38, P = 0.001) by TIPS to LOS. Conclusion: TIPS did increase time on waitlist for LT. More importantly, TIPS was not associated with 30-d mortality and re-LT, but it did lengthen hospital LOS after transplantation.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety in patients treated with sorafenib vs other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Electronic databases were systematically reviewed for randomized Phase III trials comparing sorafenib with other TKIs or SIRT in advanced HCC. Sorafenib was defined as the control arm. Other TKIs or SIRT was defined as the experimental arm. Overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), objective response rate (ORR), disease-control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs) were reviewed. Four trials in the other-TKI group (n=4,218) and two in the SIRT group (n=819) were eligible. Results: Compared with sorafenib, other TKIs showed similar benefit on OS (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.93-1.24; P=0.31) and TTP (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66-1.12; P=0.26) for advanced HCC. A significant increase in ORR (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.15-2.43; P=0.008) was found with other TKIs, but no increase in DCR (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98-1.26; P=0.11) was observed. Other TKIs were associated with more frequent grade 3/4 AEs than sorafenib, including hypertension (P<0.00001), thrombocytopenia (P=0.002), fatigue (P<0.00001), decreased appetite (P<0.00001), and vomiting (P<0.0001). For locally advanced HCC, neither OS (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98-1.32; P=0.09) nor TTP (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74-1.02; P=0.10) differed significantly in SIRT and sorafenib. There was an increase in ORR (RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.69-4.00; P<0.0001), but no improvement in DCR (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-1.02; P=0.11) in the SIRT group. Fewer patients treated with SIRT had grade 3/4 AEs than those treated with sorafenib, including diarrhea (P<0.0001), fatigue (P=0.0006), and hand-foot syndrome (P=0.0002). Other TKIs were noninferior to sorafenib in OS and TTP in advanced HCC, but with increased risk of toxicities. Conclusion: Patients with locally advanced HCC treated with SIRT got similar efficacy with less toxicity to those treated with sorafenib.",

    "Abstract": "The two principal histological types of primary liver cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma, can coexist within a tumor, comprising combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA). Although the possible involvement of liver stem/progenitor cells has been proposed for the pathogenesis of cHCC-CCA, the cells might originate from transformed hepatocytes that undergo ductular transdifferentiation or dedifferentiation. We previously demonstrated that concomitant introduction of mutant HRASV12 (HRAS) and Myc into mouse hepatocytes induced dedifferentiated tumors that expressed fetal/neonatal liver genes and proteins. Here, we examine whether the phenotype of HRAS- or HRAS/Myc-induced tumors might be affected by the disruption of the Trp53 gene, which has been shown to induce biliary differentiation in mouse liver tumors. Hepatocyte-derived liver tumors were induced in heterozygous and homozygous p53-knockout (KO) mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection of HRAS- or Myc-containing transposon cassette plasmids, which were modified by deleting loxP sites, with a transposase-expressing plasmid. The HRAS-induced and HRAS/Myc-induced tumors in the wild-type mice demonstrated histological features of HCC, whereas the phenotype of the tumors generated in the p53-KO mice was consistent with cHCC-CCA. The expression of fetal/neonatal liver proteins, including delta-like 1, was detected in the HRAS/Myc-induced but not in the HRAS-induced cHCC-CCA tissues. The dedifferentiation in the HRAS/Myc-induced tumors was more marked in the homozygous p53-KO mice than in the heterozygous p53-KO mice and was associated with activation of Myc and YAP and suppression of ERK phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the loss of p53 promotes ductular differentiation of hepatocyte-derived tumor cells through either transdifferentiation or Myc-mediated dedifferentiation.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is a well-known activator of both protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal cascade triggering a lot of effects in many non-tumor and tumor cells. We have reported activation of PKCalpha isozyme was specifically required for TPA-induced ERK (MAPK) signaling that mediated gene expressions of the CDK inhibitors p15(INK4b) and p16 (INK4a) leading to growth inhibition of hepatoma cell HepG2. We further investigated the upstream signal molecule linking PKCalpha to ERK. In the Ras activation assay, HepG2 cell exhibited substantial amount of Ras activity. Treatment of the cell with 50nM TPA for 10min slightly inhibited Ras activity by about 10-20%. Pretreatment of the cell with 10microM manumycin A, which abolish basal Ras activity, did not prevent TPA-triggered ERK phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation coupled with kinase assay demonstrated that MEK-1 activity was strongly induced by treatment of TPA for 5-30min in HepG2. In contrast, c-Raf activity was not significantly induced by TPA within 5-15min. Consistently, Western blot of Phospho(ser-218/222)-MEK demonstrated that phosphorylation of MEK-1 was greatly induced by 50nM TPA, which can be prevented by the PKC inhibitor Bisindolylmaleimides II. Moreover, pretreatment of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, but not c-Raf inhibitor prevented the TPA-induced ERK phosphorylation, gene expression of p15(INK4b) and p16 (INK4a) and growth inhibition of HepG2. In addition, transient expression of a dominant negative Raf mutant in HepG2 did not prevent these effects of TPA. Constitutive expression of an active PKCalpha mutant in HepG2 enhanced phosphorylation of both MEK and ERK accompanied with induction of gene expression of p16(INK4a) and growth inhibition of HepG2. In contrast, Ras and Raf activity were not increased by expression of active PKCalpha. Taken together, we conclude that PKCalpha may activate MEK, independently of Raf and Ras, to trigger sustained ERK (MAPK) signaling and cell cycle arrest of HepG2 induced by TPA.",

    "Abstract": "Glypican-3 (GPC3), a member of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, attaches to the cell membrane and is frequently observed to be elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, GPC3 is not detected in normal liver tissues and benign liver lesions. Consequently, GPC3 is currently being used as a diagnostic biomarker and HCC-specific positron emission computed tomography probe to identify HCCs in normal liver tissues and benign liver lesions. The overexpression of GPC-3 in serum or liver tissue also predicts poor prognosis for HCC patients. In addition, GPC3 promotes HCC growth and metastasis by activating the canonical Wnt and other signaling pathways. Targeting of GPC3, including GC33, HN3 and YP7, might offer new immunotherapeutic tools for HCC treatment.",

    "Abstract": "The ependymoma is the second most common malignant brain tumor of childhood; however, its molecular basis is poorly understood. The formation of multiple ependymomas has been reported as an occasional feature of Turcot syndrome type 2 (TS2), a familial cancer syndrome caused by inherited mutations of the APC tumor suppressor gene, and characterised by the concurrence of a primary CNS tumor (predominantly medulloblastoma) and multiple colorectal adenomas. APC is a critical component of the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway, which is disrupted in sporadic cancers (e.g., colorectal adenomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and medulloblastomas) by somatic mutations affecting multiple genes encoding alternative pathway components, including APC and CTNNB1 (encoding beta-catenin). To investigate any role for genetic disruption of the Wnt/Wingless pathway in sporadic ependymomas, we performed mutation analysis of APC and CTNNB1 in 77 primary tumors. Two synonymous APC polymorphisms (PRO1442PRO; THR1493THR) were identified, which were detected at equivalent rates in ependymomas and control nonneoplastic DNA samples (n =50); however, no further APC or CTNNB1 sequence variations were found. In summary, although inherited APC mutations may be associated with ependymoma development in certain TS2 cases, these data indicate that somatic mutations affecting APC and CTNNB1 do not play a major role in the pathogenesis of sporadic ependymomas.",

    "Abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) is a mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and has been found to be a tumor suppressor in several types of tumors. However, the roles of IDH2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (GC) as well as underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, the IDH2 and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) levels in the specimens from 30 GC patients were investigated by Western blot and ELISA, respectively. Their relationship was examined by correlation analyses. Patient survival with high IDH2 levels and low IDH2 levels was compared. IDH2 levels, and MMP7 levels were modified in a human GC cell line. The effects of IDH2 or MMP7 modulation on the expression of each other were analyzed. The dependence of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling was examined using a specific inhibitor. We found that the IDH2 levels significantly decreased in GC, and were even lower in GC with metastases, compared to those without metastases. IDH2 levels inversely correlated with MMP7 levels in GC. GC patients with low IDH2 had lower 5-year survival. MMP7 levels did not regulate IDH2 levels, while IDH2 inhibited MMP7 levels in GC cells, in a NF-κB signaling dependent manner. Together, these data suggest that IDH2 may be a tumor suppressor in that its loss may promote malignant progression of GC via NF-κB-dependent increases in MMP7 activity.",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies on mutations in cancer genomes have distinguished driver mutations from passenger mutations, which occur as byproducts of cancer development. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) project identified 299 genes and 24 pathways/biological processes that drive tumor progression (Cell 173: 371-385 e318, 2018). Of the 299 driver genes, 12 genes are involved in histones, histone methylation, and demethylation (Table 1). Among these 12 genes, those encoding the histone demethylases JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A were identified as cancer driver genes. Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH)1/2, drive tumor progression by producing an oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), which is a competitive inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate, O2-dependent dioxygenases such as Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases, and DNA demethylases. Studies on oncometabolites suggest that histone demethylases mediate metabolic changes in chromatin structure. We have reviewed the most recent findings regarding cancer-specific metabolic reprogramming and the tumor-suppressive roles of JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A. We have also discussed mutations in other isoforms such as the JARID1A, 1B, 1D of KDM5 subfamilies and the JMJD3/KDM6B of KDM6 subfamilies, which play opposing roles in tumor progression as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer cell type.

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the TP53 gene are the most common alterations in human tumours. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related to exposure to aflatoxin B1, a specific G>T transversion in codon 249 is classically described as a hot spot. However, AFB1 is suspected to be a potent carcinogen in tissues other than the liver. By using the FASAY functional assay in yeast, the present study aimed at depicting the mutational pattern of TP53 in normal human fibroblasts after in vitro exposure to AFB1. Molecular analysis of mutants revealed that codon 245 was the main hot spot, whereas no mutations were found in codon 249. The locations of mutations within GG and GC/CG sequences are well in accordance with AFB1-adduct location data. In our assay with normal human fibroblasts, AFB1 mainly induced G>A transitions, followed by G>T and A>G mutations. This suggests that G>T transversions at codon 249 were likely the result of a selection bias in human HCC rather than a true fingerprint of AFB1 adducts. Indeed, a comparison of the mutation pattern with that found in human HCC excluding codon 249 reveals that the two spectra are quite similar. Furthermore, the similarity between our in vitro spectrum with that identified in AFB1-induced lung tumours in mice suggests that AFB1 may be a potent lung carcinogen in humans.",

    "Abstract": "The treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has been revolutionized in an era of all-oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) since 2014. Satisfactory treatment efficacy and tolerability can be provided by novel DAAs. Nevertheless, there are still some unmet needs and emerging issues in the treatment of CHC in the DAA era. Certain hard-to-cure populations are prone to have inferior treatment responses, including patients with severe liver decompensation, active hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 (HCV-3) infection and those who experience multiple DAA treatment failures. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during and after DAA treatment has raised concern regarding the use of prophylactic antivirals against HBV throughout DAA treatment. However, the standard strategy for the use of prophylactic antivirals is not uniform across regional guidelines. In the post-sustained virological response (SVR) period, HCC still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients. Due to the relatively short follow-up period, the net benefit of the achievement of an SVR by DAAs in the reduction of extrahepatic manifestations has not yet been determined. Attention must also be paid to HCV reinfection, particularly in high-risk populations. The most critical and unmet need for HCV elimination is the large gap in the HCV care cascade at the population level. To accomplish the World Health Organization (WHO)'s goal for HCV elimination by 2030, the expansion of access to HCV care requires a continuous effort to overcome practical and political challenges.",

Methods: The MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from January 1, 2016 to July 23, 2020 for studies reporting the proportion of CEUS LR-M in HCC and non-HCC malignancies. The meta-analytic pooled proportions of HCC and non-HCC malignancies in the CEUS LR-M category were calculated. The meta-analytic frequencies of CEUS LR-M imaging features in nonHCC malignancies were also determined. Risk of bias and applicability were evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Results: Twelve studies reporting the diagnostic performance of the CEUS LR-M category were identified, as well as seven studies reporting the frequencies of individual CEUS LR-M imaging features. The pooled proportions of HCC and non-HCC malignancies in the CEUS LR-M category were 54% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44% to 65%) and 40% (95% CI, 28% to 53%), respectively. The pooled frequencies of individual CEUS LR-M imaging features in non-HCC malignancies were 30% (95% CI, 17% to 45%) for rim arterial phase hyperenhancement, 79% (95% CI, 66% to 90%) for early (<60 s) washout, and 42% (95% CI, 21% to 64%) for marked washout. Conclusion: In total, 94% of CEUS LR-M lesions were malignancies, with HCCs representing 54% and non-HCC malignancies representing 40%. The frequencies of individual CEUS LR-M imaging features varied; early washout showed the highest frequency for non-HCC malignancies.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Many aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the exact function of circ_0001175 in HCC cells is unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the expression characteristics of circ_0001175 in HCC and its effects on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells, and to explore the potential mechanism. Materials and methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were carried out to detect circ_0001175, microRNA-130a-5p (miR-130a-5p) and sorting nexin 5 (SNX5) expressions in HCC tissues and cells; cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), BrdU and Transwell assays were conducted to detect the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. A lung metastasis model in nude mice was used to examine the effect of circ_0001175 on the metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Bioinformatics prediction, luciferase reporter gene experiment, Ago2-RIP experiment and RNA pull-down assay were adopted to identify the binding relationships among circ_0001175, miR-130a-5p and SNX5. Results: Circ_0001175 and SNX5 expressions were up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, while miR-130a-5p expression was down-regulated. Abnormal expressions of circ_0001175, miR-130a-5p and SNX5 were associated with poor clinicopathological features of HCC patients; circ_0001175 facilitated HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and promoted lung metastasis in vivo; miR-130a-5p inhibited the above malignant biological behaviors of HCC cells, and it could reverse the function of circ_0001175. SNX5 was identified as a target gene of miR-130a-5p, and circ_0001175 could sponge miR-130a-5p and up-regulate the expression of SNX5 in HCC cells. Conclusion: Circ_0001175 is highly expressed in HCC and facilitates HCC progression through regulating miR-130a-5p/SNX5 axis.",

    "Abstract": "Cells in the locus coeruleus (LC) constitute the sole source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain and change their discharge rates according to vigilance state. In addition to its well established role in vigilance, NE affects synaptic plasticity in the postnatal critical period (CP) of development. One form of CP synaptic plasticity affected by NE results from monocular occlusion, which leads to physiological and cytoarchitectural alterations in central visual areas. Selective suppression of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in the CP kitten enhances the central effects of monocular occlusion. The mechanisms responsible for heightened cortical plasticity following REMS deprivation (REMSD) remain undetermined. One possible mediator of an increase in plasticity is continuous NE outflow, which presumably persists during extended periods of REMSD. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of NE and serves as a marker for NE-producing cells. We selectively suppressed REMS in kittens for 1 week during the CP. The number and size of LC cells expressing immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH-ir) was assessed in age-matched REMS-deprived (RD)-, treatment-control (TXC)-, and home cage-reared (HCC) animals. Sleep amounts and slow wave activity (SWA) were also examined relative to baseline. Time spent in REMS during the study was lower in RD compared to TXC animals, and RD kittens increased SWA delta power in the latter half of the REMSD period. The estimated total number of TH-ir cells in LC was significantly lower in the RD than in the TXC kittens and numerically lower than in the HCC animals. The size of LC cells expressing TH-ir was greatest in the HCC group. HCC cells were significantly larger than TH-ir cells in the RD kittens. These data are consistent with presumed reduction in NE in forebrain areas, including visual cortex, caused by 1 week of REMSD.",

    "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging chronic liver disease that may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to determine the association between the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and NAFLD severity using semi-quantitative ultrasonography (US). A total of 614 participants were recruited from the community. NAFLD was evaluated according to the ultrasonographic Fatty Liver Indicator (US-FLI), which is a semi-quantitative liver ultrasound score. Insulin resistance was estimated with the homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). NAFLD and MetS were found in 53.7 and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. Linear relationships were found between the severity of NAFLD and waist circumference, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, HDL-C and blood pressure. After adjusting for confounding factors, i.e., body mass index and HOMA-IR, the odds ratios for MetS were 3.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-8.83) for those with mild NAFLD and 9.4 (95% CI: 3.54-24.98) for those with moderate-to-severe NAFLD compared to those without NAFLD. The combination of the HOMA-IR and US-FLI scores better differentiated MetS than the HOMA-IR alone. In addition to obesity, the severity of NAFLD and the HOMA-IR both play important roles in MetS. Whether NAFLD is a component of MetS warrants further research.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: The programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is a potent immunoregulatory molecule which is responsible for the negative regulation of T-cell activation and peripheral tolerance. Recently, overexpression of PD-1 has been reported to contribute to immune system evasion and poor survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A common single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 4 of PD-1 gene called PD-1.3 has been reported to influence PD-1 expression, but its association with HCC has yet to be investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this polymorphism could be involved in the risk of HCC susceptibility. Methods: The genotype frequency of PD-1.3 polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 236 subjects with HCC and 236 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol status. Results: No statistically significant differences were found in the genotype distributions of the PD-1.3 polymorphism among HCC and cancer-free control subjects (P=0.22). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate for the first time that the PD-1.3 polymorphism has not been in any major role in genetic susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinogenesis, at least in the population studied here. Independent studies are needed to validate our findings in a larger series, as well as in patients of different ethnic origins.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-protein coding RNAs with posttranscriptional regulatory functions as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Aberrant expression and structural alteration of miRNAs are considered to participate in tumorigenesis and cancer development. It has been suggested that the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) can alter miRNA processing, expression, and/or binding to target mRNA and represent another type of genetic variability that can contribute to the susceptibility of human cancers. A G/C polymorphism (rs2910164), which is located in the sequence of miR-146a precursor, results in a change from G:U to C:U in its stem region. Methods: To determine the association of the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in Turkish population, a hospital-based case-control study was designed consisting of 222 subjects with HCC and 222 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol status. The genotype frequency of miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Results: No statistically significant differences were found in the allele or genotype distributions of the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism among HCC and cancer-free control subjects (p>0.05). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism has no major role in genetic susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinogenesis, at least in the population studied here.

    "Abstract": "Ectopic liver (EL) is a rare congenital abnormality, which is localised most commonly in the wall of the gallbladder. Histoarchitectural abnormalities, which lead to impaired transfer of blood and bile, as well as well demarcation, are characteristic features of ectopic liver nodules. Both features may explain the discrepancies between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases originating from ectopic liver in comparison to HCC cases originating from orthotopic liver: the strong propensity of ectopic liver to the development of HCC. The latter feature may be linked to the better treatment prognosis in patients with HCC originating from ectopic liver tissue in comparison to those with HCC within orthotopic liver. In this paper, we discuss these differences based on a unique case of pure HCC, which developed in a small ectopic liver nodule in the pancreas.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may finally lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and also associated with insulin resistance (IR). Naringenin (NGEN), a flavonoid found in grapefruit, has anti-virus, anti-inflammation and insulin sensitization effects. In the present study we examined the effects of NGEN on HCV core protein (HCVCP) infection induced IR and investigated the mechanism involved. We found that NGEN ameliorated IR and glucose tolerance in HCVCP infected mice by increase the phosphorylation of Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 site, and also inhibited the inflammation cytokine production and T-cell immune response. Similar to the in vivo results, NGEN also improved the insulin response and showed anti-inflammation effect in HCVCP infected Huh-7.5.1 cells. In addition, NGEN up-regulated the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) both in protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, overexpress of PTEN abolished the HCVCP-stimulated IR and decreased the inflammation cytokine release. NGEN also blocked the interaction between HCVCP and p53, upregulated the endogenous p21/waf1 expression which indiacting the activation of p53. The p53 wild type could upregulate NGEN-stimulated PTEN expression while R273H mut-p53 showed no similar function. Our data reveals that NGEN increases insulin sensitivity in HCVCP infected liver by up-regulating PTEN in p53-dependent manner.",

    "Abstract": "This phase I, dose-escalation study evaluated the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib, a triple angiokinase inhibitor, in Japanese patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and mild/moderate liver impairment. Thirty patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled to groups, depending on whether liver impairment was mild (group I, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2× upper limit of normal and Child-Pugh score 5 [n = 14] or 6 [n = 2]) or moderate (group II, Child-Pugh score 5-6 and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >2× to ≤5× upper limit of normal [n = 7] or Child-Pugh score 7 [n = 7]); 22 patients had prior sorafenib treatment. Nintedanib was given twice daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events, starting at 150 mg (group I) or 100 mg (group II) and escalating to 200 mg. The primary objective was to define the maximum tolerated dose based on occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities during cycle 1 (grade ≥3 non-hematological and grade 4 hematological adverse events). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported during cycle 1 and the maximum tolerated dose for both groups was 200 mg twice daily. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite). No patients discontinued nintedanib due to adverse events; 31% of group I and 21% of group II had dose reductions. Median time to progression was 2.8 months (95% confidence interval, 1.05-5.52) for group I and 3.2 months (95% confidence interval, 0.95-6.70) for group II. Nintedanib showed a manageable safety profile and efficacy signals, including in patients previously treated with sorafenib. Clinical trial registration NCT01594125; 1199.120 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

    "Abstract": "The phosphate and tension homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene that controls a variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, migration, and death. The association of PTEN polymorphisms with risk for many cancers has been reported, but hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been studied. The present study is the first attempt to assess the association of PTEN polymorphisms with HCC susceptibility. We genotyped one insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs34421660) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and three tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10490920, rs532678, and rs701848) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 134 HCC patients and 215 healthy controls. We found that the four polymorphisms were not associated with HCC, at both the allele and genotype levels. However, after reconstructing PTEN haplotypes according to genotyping data and linkage disequilibrium status of four polymorphisms, we found that the T-C-C-del haplotype was associated with decreased HCC risk (odds ratio = 0.19, 95% confidence interval = 0.06-0.56) and the T-T-T-ins haplotype was associated with increased HCC risk (odds ratio = 1.63, 95% confidence interval = 1.14-2.33). Thus, our results prove that PTEN haplotypes may be associated with HCC susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health challenge on the global scale. Affecting hundreds of millions worldwide, HBV is a leading risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Clinical outcomes from chronic HBV infection are varied and appear to be influenced by a complex and dysregulated host immune response. In turn, much attention has been given to the immunologic response to HBV in an effort to identify host factors that lead to the development of HCC. However, the role of nonimmunologic host factors, such as chronic stress, in HBV-related HCC is poorly defined. Indeed, a growing appreciation for the effects of stress on chronic liver diseases raises the question of its role in chronic HBV infection. In this light, the present review will untangle the roles of key host factors in HBV-related HCC with an emphasis on chronic stress as a viable contributor. First discussed is the interplay of stress, inflammation and chronic liver disease. The host immune response's role as a driver of HBV-related HCC is then reviewed, allowing for a close exploration of the effects of stress on immune function in chronic hepatitis B and as a potential risk factor for HBV-related HCC.",

We determined the incidence of adverse events with this combination therapy in patients with advanced HCC at our institution and analyzed the treatment and survival outcomes. Materials and methods: We reviewed the records of 19 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer class B or C HCC who underwent treatment with Y90 RMS (for 21 sessions) while receiving full or reduced doses of sorafenib between January 2008 and May 2010. Therapy response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. We evaluated median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as well as hepatic and extrahepatic disease PFS and incidence of adverse events. Results: The median patient age was 67 years, and portal or hepatic venous invasion was present in eight patients (42%). Ten patients received reduced doses of sorafenib. The median Y90 radiation activity delivered was 41.2 mCi. The partial response of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was observed in four patients (19%). The median hepatic disease PFS was 7.82 months, extrahepatic disease PFS was 8.94 months, OS was 19.52 months, and PFS was 6.63 months. Ninety days after treatment with Y90 RMS, five patients (26%) had grade II adverse events and four patients (21%) had grade III adverse events. Conclusion: OS and PFS outcomes were superior to those observed in prior studies evaluating sorafenib alone in patients with a similar disease status, warranting further study of this treatment combination.",

In addition, MTT assays, flow cytometry and TUNEL analysis showed that DHM possessed strong anti-tumor properties, evidenced not only by reduced cell proliferation but also by enhanced apoptosis in QGY7701 and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The expressions of Notch1, Hes1, Bcl-2 and Bax were determined by Western blot. Results: Among the tested samples (n = 64), the expression levels of Notch1 (75% of patients) and Hes1 (79.7% of patients) mRNA in tumor tissues were higher than in the normal liver tissues. There was a negative correlation between the expression of Notch1 and the degree of differentiation and positively correlated with the Alpha Fetal Protein concentration. The viability of HCC cells treated with DHM was significantly inhibited in a dose and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis was induced in HepG2 and QGY7701 cell lines following 24 h of DHM treatment. After treatment with DHM, the protein expression of Notch1 was downregulated, the apoptosis-related protein Bax was upregulated and Bcl2 was downregulated. Notch1 siRNA further enhanced the anti-tumor properties of DHM. Conclusion: Notch1 is involved in the development of HCC and DHM inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of Notch1.",

    "Abstract": "Kratom is an herbal product derived from the leaves of Southeast Asian Mitragyna speciosa trees. It has traditionally been used by indigenous people to relieve fatigue and manage pain, diarrhea, or opioid withdrawal. The use of kratom has become more commonplace in the United States for similar purposes. Only rare reports of kratom liver toxicity exist in the literature but without histologic characterization. Herein, we report one case of kratom use-associated liver toxicity in a 38-year-old patient. The patient complained of dark colored urine and light colored stools after using kratom. He had unremarkable physical examination. Laboratory testing at presentation revealed elevated alanine aminotransferase (389 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (220 U/L), total bilirubin (5.1 mg/dL), and alkaline phosphatase (304 U/L). There was no serology evidence of viral hepatitis A, B, and C. The acetaminophen level at presentation was below detectable limits. Ultrasound examination of the right upper quadrant revealed normal echogenicity and contour of the liver without bile ductal dilatation or disease of the gallbladder. The patient underwent liver biopsy 4 days after the initial presentation which revealed a pattern of acute cholestatic liver injury including zone 3 hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis, focal hepatocyte dropout, mild portal inflammation, and bile duct injury. Kratom was stopped, the patient improved clinically and biochemically and was discharged 8 days after the initial presentation. To our best knowledge, this is the first case report detailing the histology of kratom use-associated liver injury.",

    "Abstract": "Genetic factors play an important role in shaping the biologic characteristics of malignant tumors, especially in young patients. We aimed to determine the clinicopathologic features of endometrial cancer (EC) in patients younger than 50 years with a family history of cancer.Overall, 229 patients with EC, including 40 with a positive family history of cancer (PFH) and 189 with a negative family history of cancer (NFH), were enrolled in this case-control study. The family history of cancer in a 2-generation pedigree was recorded for the PFH group. Clinicopathologic features such as menarche age, body mass index, personal cancer history, grade, and histologic type were compared between the 2 groups. Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins including MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in surgical samples. Univariate (Pearson Chi-squared test, Fisher exact test, T test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, logistic regression) statistics and stepwise multivariate logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with PFH in the analysis.Among young patients with EC, the PFH group had younger age-of-onset age of endometrial cancer (≤40 years) (odds ratio [OR] = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.01-4.82) than the NFH group. The proportion of overweight/obese patients was high in both the NFH (58.7%) and PFH (80%) groups. Colorectal, lung, endometrial, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma accounted for 58.6% of all cancer types among 1st- and 2nd-degree relatives. Additionally, 19.2% of patients displayed deficiency in at least 1 MMR protein, with a significantly higher proportion of MMR protein deficiency in the PFH group than in the NFH group (adjusted OR = 4.81, 95% CI: 2.14-8.83).Clinicopathologic features differ for young patients with EC with and without a family history of cancer. Surveillance of age-of-onset and family history of endometrial cancer, reduction of barriers to healthy lifestyles, and development of risk-appropriate Lynch syndrome screening tools, such as IHC, are needed for these women in Shanghai and other developing cities in China.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To provide a simple surrogate marker predictive of liver cirrhosis (LC). Methods: Specimens from 302 patients who underwent resection for hepatocellular carcinoma between January 2006 and December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Based on pathologic findings, patients were divided into groups based on whether or not they had LC. Parameters associated with hepatic functional reserve were compared in these two groups using Mann-Whitney U-test for univariate analysis. Factors differing significantly in univariate analyses were entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: There were significant differences between the LC group (n = 100) and non-LC group (n = 202) in prothrombin activity, concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, cholinesterase, type IV collagen, hyaluronic acid, indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min, maximal removal rate of technitium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid-galactosyl human serum albumin and ratio of mean platelet volume to platelet count (MPV/PLT). Multivariate analysis showed that prothrombin activity, concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and hyaluronic acid, and MPV/PLT ratio were factors independently predictive of LC. The area under the curve value for MPV/PLT was 0.78, with a 0.8 cutoff value having a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 78%. Conclusion: The MPV/PLT ratio, which can be determined simply from the complete blood count, may be a simple surrogate marker predicting LC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previous studies have shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promotes cell proliferation through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and participates in the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we focused on the functional polymorphism of EGFR in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), aiming to reveal the potential mechanisms by which functional polymorphism is associated with the risk and development of HCC in the Han Chinese population. Methods: This study was a hospital-based case-control study. A total of 600 patients were enrolled, and another 600 healthy volunteers served as controls. The miR-associated SNPs in EGFR were screened, and genotyping was performed by TaqMan allele differential analysis. In this study, genotyping, real-time PCR, cell transfection and double luciferase reporter gene were used for subsequent analysis. Results: HBV/HCV infection instead of alcohol exposure, smoking exposure, hypertension or diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of HCC. Compared with TT genotypes, TG and GG genotypes of EGFR rs884225 were significantly associated with reduced HCC risk. The stratified analysis of association between rs884225 and HCC subgroup feature reveal a highly correlation with tumor size. Furthermore, qRT-PCR confirmed that EGFR rs884225, TG and GG genotypes were more likely to bind to miR-3196 and down-regulate EGFR level in cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. Conclusion: This study suggested that EGFR rs884225 is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer and may be a developing biomarker.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the long-term follow-up results of percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Korea. Materials and methods: Sixty-eight nodular HCCs initially detected in 64 patients, were subjected to US-guided PEI as a first-line treatment. Long-term survival rates, local tumor progression rates, and complications were evaluated, as were the influences of tumor size and Child-Pugh class on these variables. Results: No major complications occurred. The overall survival rates of the 64 patients at three and five years were 71% and 39%, and their cancer-free survival rates were 22% and 15%, respectively. The overall survival rate of patients with a small HCC (< or =2 cm) was significantly higher (p = 0.014) than that of patients with a medium-sized HCC (< or =2 cm). The overall survival rate of patients with Child-Pugh class A was significantly higher (p = 0.049) than that of patients with Child-Pugh class B. Of 59 cases with no residual tumor, local tumor progression was observed in ablation zones in 18, and this was not found to be significantly influenced by tumor size or Child-Pugh class. Conclusion: The results of our investigation of the long-term survival rates of PEI in HCC patients in Korea (a hepatitis B virus-endemic area) were consistent with those reported previously in hepatitis C endemic areas. Patients with a smaller tumor or a better liver function exhibited superior survival rates.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib), an irreversible inhibitor of JAK3 and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase family, in comparison with placebo in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: An 8-week, phase II, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted. Seventy patients who were seropositive for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies and/or rheumatoid factor were randomized 3:2 to receive oral PF-06651600 (200 mg once daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. Eligible patients had an inadequate response to methotrexate, and the study design allowed up to 50% of patients to have previously received 1 tumor necrosis factor inhibitor that was inadequately effective and/or not tolerated. The primary end point was change from baseline in the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) score at week 8, assessed by Bayesian analysis using an informative prior distribution for placebo response. Results: Mean change from baseline in the SDAI score at week 8 was greater in the PF-06651600 group (-26.1 [95% credible interval -29.7, -22.4]) than in the placebo group (-16.8 [95% credible interval -20.9, -12.7]; P < 0.001). Most adverse events (AEs) were mild in severity, and no treatment-related serious AEs, severe AEs, or deaths were reported. The most common classes of AE were infections and infestations as well as skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; there was 1 mild case of herpes simplex in the PF-06651600 group that was considered to be treatment related, which resolved within 3 days without study treatment discontinuation or antiviral therapy. Conclusion: Treatment with the oral JAK3/TEC inhibitor PF-06651600 (200 mg once daily) was associated with significant improvements in RA disease activity and was generally well-tolerated in this small 8-week study.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, biopsy is a diagnostic option for focal hepatic lesions depending on the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography-guided core-needle biopsy (CNB) according to LI-RADS categories. Methods: A total of 145 High-risk patients for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by CNB for a focal hepatic lesion preoperatively were retrospectively enrolled. Focal hepatic lesions on MRI were evaluated according to LI-RADS version 2018. Pathologic results were categorized into HCC, non-HCC malignancies, and benignity. The categorization was defined as correct when the CNB pathology and surgical pathology reports were identical. Nondiagnostic results were defined as inadequate CNB pathology findings for a specific diagnosis. The proportion of correct categorizations was calculated for each LI-RADS category, excluding nondiagnostic results. Results: After excluding 16 nondiagnostic results, 131 lesions were analyzed (45 LR-5, 24 LR-4, 4 LR-3, and 58 LR-M). All LR-5 lesions were HCC, and CNB correctly categorized 97.8% (44/45) of LR-5 lesions. CNB correctly categorized all 24 LR-4 lesions, 16.7% (4/24) of which were non-HCC malignancies. All LR-M lesions were malignant, and 62.1% (36/58) were non-HCC malignancies. CNB correctly categorized 93.1% (54/58) of LR-M lesions, and 12.5% (3/24) of lesions with CNB results of HCC were confirmed as non-HCC malignancies. Conclusion: In agreement with AASLD guidelines, CNB could be helpful for LR-4 lesions, but is unnecessary for LR-5 lesions. In LR-M lesions, CNB results of HCC did not exclude non-HCC malignancy.",

    "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as a major public health issue and is associated with significant liver-related morbidity and mortality. At present, there are no approved drug therapies for NASH. The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ; encoded by WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 [WWTR1]) is up-regulated in hepatocytes in NASH liver from humans and has been shown to causally promote inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of NASH. As a preclinical test of targeting hepatocyte TAZ to treat NASH, we injected stabilized TAZ small interfering RNA (siRNA) bearing the hepatocyte-specific ligand N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc-siTAZ) into mice with dietary-induced NASH. As a preventative regimen, GalNAc-siTAZ inhibited inflammation, hepatocellular injury, and the expression of profibrogenic mediators, accompanied by decreased progression from steatosis to NASH. When administered to mice with established NASH, GalNAc-siTAZ partially reversed hepatic inflammation, injury, and fibrosis. Conclusion: Hepatocyte-targeted siTAZ is potentially a novel and clinically feasible treatment for NASH.",

    "Abstract": "Germline mutations in the LKB1 gene are responsible for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which is characterized by gastrointestinal hamartomas and increasing risk of cancer. Mice with Lkb1(+/-) mutation develop gastric hamartomas after >20 weeks of age, and hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas >30 weeks. It has been reported that, in PJS patients, carcinomas progressed from hamartomas contain p53 mutations, and that LKB1 regulates p53-dependent apoptosis. To investigate the roles of LKB1 and p53 mutations in tumorigenesis, we constructed compound mutant mice of Lkb1 and p53 genes. In the Lkb1(+/-)p53(-/-) mice, formation of gastric hamartomas and hepatic tumors was accelerated. However, histopathology of hamartomas was similar between Lkb1(+/-)p53(-/-) and Lkb1(+/-) mice, and Lkb1 genotype remained heterozygous, suggesting that the p53 mutation affected hamartoma initiation. Contrary to the heterozygous hamartomas in the stomach and duodenum, the hepatic adenomas in Lkb1(+/-)p53(-/-) mice showed loss of Lkb1 heterozygosity (LOH), suggesting that lack of p53 stimulated Lkb1 LOH and tumor initiation in the liver. Taken together, these results indicate that lack of p53 causes earlier onsets of gastric hamartomas and hepatic tumors in Lkb1(+/-)p53(-/-) mice.",

    "Abstract": "SHP-2 protein tyrosine phosphatase plays an important role in activation of the RAS-dependent signaling. Gain-of-function mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes SHP-2, have been found in the leukemia-prone developmental disorder Noonan syndrome as well as sporadic childhood leukemias, indicating that SHP-2 is a bona fide human oncoprotein. However, the role of SHP-2 mutations in non-hematological malignancies remains obscure. Here, we screened for PTPN11 mutations in primary solid tumors and identified a 1520C>A mutation that causes threonine-507 to lysine (T507K) substitution in the phosphatase domain of SHP-2 in a case of hepatocellular carcinoma. T507K SHP-2 exhibited altered substrate specificity with slightly elevated basal phosphatase activity. Upon expression in NIH3T3 cells, T507K SHP-2 induced transformed foci, which was not observed with wild type, Noonan-specific or leukemia-specific SHP-2. Furthermore, NIH3T3 cells transformed by T507K SHP-2 showed anchorage-independent growth and developed tumors in nude mice. These results indicate that quantitative and/or qualitative alteration in phosphatase activity determines the transforming potential as well as target cell/tissue spectrum of individual SHP-2 mutants as oncoproteins. Although rare in solid tumors, the identified T507K SHP-2 represents a distinct class of SHP-2 mutants with oncogenic RAS-like transforming activity, which could contribute to the development of solid tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To identify the new alternative splicing variants of human CYP2D6 in human extratumoral liver tissue with RT-PCR and sequencing. Methods: Full length of human CYP2D6 cDNAs was amplificated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a human extratumoral liver tissue and cloned into pGEM-T vector. The cDNA was sequenced. Exons from 1 to 4 of human CYP2D6 cDNAs were also amplificated by RT-PCR from extratumoral liver tissues of 17 human hepatocellular carcinomas. Some RT-PCR products were sequenced. Exons 1 to 4 of CYP2D6 gene were amplified by PCR from extratumoral liver tissue DNA. Two PCR products from extratumoral liver tissues expressing skipped mRNA were partially sequenced. Results: One of the CYP2D6 cDNAs had 470 nucleotides from 79 to 548 (3' portion of exons 1 to 5' portion of exon 4), and was skipped. Exons 1 to 4 of CYP2D6 cDNA were assayed with RT-PCR in 17 extratumoral liver tissues. Both wild type and skipped mRNAs were expressed in 4 samples, only wild type mRNA was expressed in 5 samples, and only skipped mRNA was expressed in 8 samples. Two more variants were identified by sequencing the RT-PCR products of exons 1 to 4 of CYP2D6 cDNA. The second variant skipped 411 nucleotides from 175 to 585. This variant was identified in 4 different liver tissues by sequencing the RT-PCR products. We sequenced partially 2 of the PCR products amplified of CYP2D6 exon 1 to exon 4 from extratumoral liver tissue genomic DNA that only expressed skipped mRNA by RT-PCR. No point mutations around exon 1, intron 1, and exon 4, and no deletion in CYP2D6 gene were detected. The third variant was the skipped exon 3 , and 153 bp was lost. Conclusion: Three new alternative splicing variants of CYP2D6 mRNA have been identified. They may not be caused by gene mutation and may lose CYP2D6 activity and act as a down-regulator of CYP2D6.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/aims: Surveillance programs and imaging modality developments have increased the detection rate of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In particular, liver transplantation produces good results and is now regarded an alternative to liver resection. However, optimal treatment for small HCC is still debated, and thus, the authors designed this study to document clinicopathological characteristics, to identify the prognostic factors of small HCC, and to determine the effectiveness of surgery. Methods: A total of 507 patients underwent curative liver resection for HCC between January 1996 and August 2006 in our institution. One hundred and thirty four of these patients with a single HCC of less than 3 cm and no gross vascular invasion were enrolled. Results: Major resection was performed in 32 (23.9%) patients; there was no postoperative mortality. Fifty-eight (43.3%) patients experienced recurrence, 53 developed intrahepatic recurrence alone, and 50 (94.3%) of 53 had tumors within the Milan criteria. Five-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 51.0% and 77.3%, respectively. Microscopic vascular invasion, positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen or antibody to hepatitis C, and an indocyanine green retention test at 15 minutes of more than 10% were found to be significantly correlated with disease-free overall survival. A platelet count of less than 100,000/mm(3) was the only independent prognostic factors of overall survival identified. Conclusions: This study showed favorable outcome comparable to the survival after liver transplantation, thus that liver resection appears to be the primary treatment option for small HCC, even in cases with poor prognostic factors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Surgical treatment of femoral neck fractures is usually performed as an urgent procedure so that restoration of the ability to stand and walk can be achieved as quickly as possible. However, orthopedic surgeons need to be aware of undertreated or untreated diseases in their patients. Organ transplant recipients require immunosuppressive agents and steroids postoperatively. Hemodialysis patients also exhibit immunological deterioration and are included among immunocompromised patients. We report a case in which conservative treatment was chosen for a hepatic transplant recipient on hemodialysis who suffered a femoral neck fracture because signs of inflammation of unknown etiology were intermittently seen. Case: The patient was a 70-year-old man who had undergone liver transplantation from a living donor as treatment for hepatocellular cancer and hepatic failure with cirrhosis. Dialysis for end-stage renal failure was initiated at approximately 1 year postoperatively. Cyclosporine was administered as an immunosuppressive agent. The patient subsequently fell off a bicycle and was unable to walk because of right hip pain. He was brought to our hospital by ambulance, and a right hip radiograph revealed a femoral neck fracture. His white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were intermittently elevated with unknown etiology. Conservative treatment was finally adopted, although a bipolar hip arthroplasty was planned. At 5 months after the injury, the patient was able to walk alone in a stable manner using a pair of crutches and was discharged. Discussion: Conservative treatment for a femoral neck fracture, which generally requires surgery, may be acceptable in organ transplant recipients on hemodialysis.",

    "Abstract": "Right hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common major operation in liver surgery; therefore, liver surgeons should know the fundamental surgical concept and techniques of the Glissonean pedicle approach. A J-shaped or reversed T laparotomy is performed in the right subcostal area. The Glissonean pedicle approach is performed at the hepatic hilus. In this approach, the right anterior and posterior Glissonean pedicles are encircled and ligated without liver dissection. The right hepatic artery, right portal vein and right hepatic duct in the hepatoduodenal ligament should be divided if the Glissonean pedicles cannot be approached easily. After confirming the border between the right and left liver, the liver parenchyma is dissected from the anterior surface of the liver to the anterior surface of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The V5 and V8 middle hepatic veins are divided and liver dissection is performed along the main middle hepatic vein. Finally, the anterior surface of the IVC and the trunk of the right hepatic vein are identified in the liver. This approach is widely known as the anterior approach described by Lai and Fan (World J Surg 20:314-8, 1996). However, this procedure had already been reported by Takasaki et al. (Shoukakigeka 7:1545-51, 1984) but since they did not report this procedure in English, their pioneering work on the anterior approach has not been recognized. The liver hanging maneuver described by Belghiti et al. (J Am Coll Surg 193:109-111, 2001) is also useful in right hepatectomy. Among the techniques used in right hepatectomy, the Glissonean pedicle approach, the anterior approach and the liver hanging maneuver are considered to be the most important.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (srHCC) is known to be a life-threatening complication with poor prognosis. Although there are various treatment modalities, there is no definite treatment guideline. The purpose of this study was to review the surgical outcome and prognosis of srHCC treated with intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and distilled water peritoneal lavage (DWPL). Methods: From March 2012 to October 2018, 9 patients with srHCC who underwent emergent surgery were reviewed. After hematoma removal, intraoperative RFA and DWPL were applied to all patients. Hepatectomy was performed if necessary. Patients with multiple tumors, distant metastasis, and vascular tumor involvement in radiologic imaging were excluded. Results: Six of 9 patients with diameters less than 7 cm were able to obtain hemostasis using RFA alone (RFA group). However, 3 patients with a tumor size of more than 10 cm underwent liver resection because they could not obtain hemostasis with RFA (hepatectomy only group). The RFA group had shorter operation time (148.3 ± 31.7 minutes vs. 251.7 ± 20.2 minutes, P < 0.05) and less red blood cell transfusion (5.8 ± 2.5 packs vs. 24.0 ± 11.5 packs, P < 0.05) than the hepatectomy only group. There was no peritoneal metastasis at long-term follow-up in the RFA group. Five-year recurrence-free survival rate was 0% in both groups. However, 5-year overall survival rate was better in the RFA group (83.3% vs. 0%, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Intraoperative RFA and DWPL are easy to perform and theoretically the best methods for managing relatively small srHCC.",

Objective: This review discusses how mutations occur that result in elevated expression the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway and lead to malignant transformation, and how effective targeting of this pathway may result in suppression of abnormal growth of cancer cells. Methods: We searched the literature for articles which dealt with altered expression of this pathway in various cancers including: hematopoietic, melanoma, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, endometrial and ovarian, breast, prostate and hepatocellular. Results/conclusions: The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is frequently aberrantly regulated in various cancers and targeting this pathway with small molecule inhibitors and may result in novel, more effective anticancer therapies.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To identify chromosomal copy number aberrations (CNAs) in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and analyze whether they are correlated with patient prognosis. Methods: One hundred and twenty patients with early-stage HCC were enrolled in our study, with the collection of formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens and clinicopathological data. Tumor areas were marked by certified pathologists on a hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide, and cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues underwent extraction of DNA, which was analyzed with the Affymetrix OncoScan platform to assess CNAs and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Ten individuals with nonmalignant disease were used as the control group. Another cohort consisting of 40 patients with stage I/II HCC were enrolled to analyze gene expression and to correlate findings with the OncoScan data. Results: Copy number amplifications occurred at chromosomes 1q21.1-q44 and 8q12.3-24.3 and deletions were found at 4q13.1-q35.2, 8p 23.2-21.1, 16q23.3-24.3, and 17p13.3-12, while LOH commonly occurred at 1p32.3, 3p21.31, 8p23.2-21.1, 16q22.1-24.3, and 17p 13.3-11 in early-stage HCC. Using Cox regression analysis, we also found that a higher percentage of genome change (≥ 60%) was an independent factor for worse prognosis in early-stage HCC (P = 0.031). Among the 875 genes in the OncoScan GeneChip, six were independent predictors of worse disease-free survival, of which three were amplified (MYC, ELAC2, and SYK) and three were deleted (GAK, MECOM, and WRN). Further, patients with HCC who exhibited ≥ 3 CNAs involving these six genes have worse outcomes compared to those who had < 3 CNAs (P < 0.001). Similarly, Asian patients with stage I HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas harboring CNAs with these genes were also predicted to have poorer outcomes. Conclusion: Patients with early-stage HCC and increased genome change or CNAs involving MYC, ELAC2, SYK, GAK, MECOM, or WRN are at risk for poorer outcome after resection.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To determine whether pretreatment evaluation with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) is effective for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with poor conspicuity on conventional ultrasonography (US). Materials and methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was waived. From June 2008 to July 2011, 82 patients having HCCs (1.2 ± 0.4 cm) with poor conspicuity on planning US for RFA were evaluated with CEUS prior to percutaneous RFA. We analyzed our database, radiologic reports, and US images in order to determine whether the location of HCC candidates on planning US coincide with that on CEUS. To avoid incomplete ablation, percutaneous RFA was performed only when HCC nodules were identified on CEUS. The rate of technical success was assessed. The cumulative rate of local tumor progression was estimated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method (mean follow-up: 24.0 ± 13.0 months). Results: Among 82 patients, 73 (89%) HCCs were identified on CEUS, whereas 9 (11%) were not. Of 73 identifiable HCCs on CEUS, the location of HCC on planning US corresponded with that on CEUS in 64 (87.7%), whereas the location did not correspond in 9 (12.3%) HCCs. Technical success was achieved for all 73 identifiable HCCs on CEUS in a single (n = 72) or two (n = 1) RFA sessions. Cumulative rates of local tumor progression were estimated as 1.9% and 15.4% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Conclusion: Pretreatment evaluation with CEUS is effective for percutaneous RFA of HCCs with poor conspicuity on conventional US.",

    "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence from molecular oncology indicates that carcinogens may induce tumors through characteristic mutations in characteristic genes for each agent. Identification of specific mutations induced by heterocyclic amines (HCAs), food-borne carcinogens, should facilitate risk assessment of HCAs in man. Identification of characteristic genes affected by HCAs will lead to identification of the genes involved in human carcinogenesis. We therefore examined tumors induced by various HCAs from these two viewpoints. With regard to forestomach tumors induced in CDF1 mice by 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), mutations of Ha-ras and p53 were observed in four of eight and two of four tumors, respectively. One papilloma examined had mutations in both Ha-ras and p53, whereas two carcinomas had only one or the other. For Zymbal gland tumors induced in F344 rats by IQ, mutations of Ha- or Ki-ras were observed in both of two papillomas and in 10 of 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), while p53 mutations were limited to only four of the SCCs. The ras mutation was thus suggested to be an early event, while p53 mutation was more associated with malignancy. In liver tumors induced in F344 rats by 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4, 5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), mutations of p53 were observed in one of two moderately-differentiated and two of two poorly-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). No such changes were found in any of nine well-differentiated HCCs, suggesting p53 mutation to be a very late event. In colon tumors induced in F344 rats by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) (nine adenocarcinomas), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) (two adenomas and nine adenocarcinomas), or 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3', 2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) (seven adenocarcinomas), a Ki-ras mutation was found in only one Glu-P-1-induced adenocarcinoma. No p53 mutations could be detected. In mammary gland carcinomas induced in F344 rats by PhIP, Ha-ras was activated in three of 17 carcinomas and p53 was mutated in one of 10 carcinomas. We therefore concluded that other genes were involved in colon and mammary carcinomas. G:C base pairs were involved in all 42 positive cases of the present study, and 36 of them were guanine base mutations. This indicates that the changes in IQ, MeIQx, PhIP and Glu-P-1 tumors were mainly caused by non-transcribed strand modifications through their major DNA adducts, N2-(guanin-8-yl)HCAs. Ha-ras mutations in the forestomach tumors induced by MeIQ were all G to T transversions at the second position of codon 13. Mutation sites of p53 did not appear to be specific in the forestomach, Zymbal gland and liver tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignant neoplasms worldwide, and is the second leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. E-cadherin is an epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and decreased E-cadherin expression in HCC is associated with a poor prognosis. This study investigates the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the E-cadherin/CDH1 gene promoter on the risk and clinicopathological characteristics of HCC METHODS: 131 HCC patients and 347 controls were recruited for this study. Genetic polymorphisms of CDH1-160 and -347 were analyzed by PCR-RFLP genotyping analysis. Results: After adjusting for other confounders, results show that individuals with the CDH1-347G/GA or GA/GA polymorphic genotypes had a significantly higher risk of developing HCC than those with the wild-type (G/G) genotype (adjusted odds ratio = 2.477; 95%CI: 1.421-4.319). Furthermore, patients with HCC with at least one mutant A allele of CDH1-160 had a 4.031-fold risk of progressing to stage III or IV. Conclusions: This study shows that SNPs in CDH1-347 gene are associated with an increased risk of HCC, and at least one mutant A allele of CDH1-160 gene is associated with the development of stage III or IV of HCC in Taiwanese.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: In addition to genetic alterations, epigenetic changes underlie tumor progression and metastasis. Promoter methylation can silence tumor suppressor genes, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote DNA damage, although the relationship between ROS and epigenetic changes in cancer cells is not clear. We sought to determine whether ROS promote hypermethylation of the promoter region of E-cadherin, a regulator of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods: HCC cells were exposed to H(2)O(2) or stably transfected to express Snail, a transcription factor that down-regulates E-cadherin expression. E-cadherin and Snail expression levels were examined by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses. The methylation status of E-cadherin was examined by methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction, bisulfite sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The interactions between Snail, histone deacetylase 1, and DNA methyltransferase 1 were assessed by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. ROS-induced stress, E-cadherin expression, Snail expression, and E-cadherin promoter methylation were confirmed in HCC tissues by immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction analyses. Results: We demonstrated that ROS induce hypermethylation of the E-cadherin promoter by increasing Snail expression. Snail induced DNA methylation of the E-cadherin promoter by recruiting histone deacetylase 1 and DNA methyltransferase 1. In human HCC tissues, we observed a correlation among ROS induction, E-cadherin down-regulation, Snail up-regulation, and E-cadherin promoter methylation. Conclusions: These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into epigenetic modulations induced by ROS in the process of carcinogenesis. They are potentially relevant to understanding the activity of ROS in silencing various tumor suppressor genes and in subsequent tumor progression and metastasis.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a benign liver tumor that most frequently occurs in young women using oral contraceptives. We report a rare case of HCA in a 29 years old female with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The first proband was her sister, who underwent a total colectomy and was genetically diagnosed as FAP. A tumor, 3.0 cm in diameter, was detected in the right lobe of the liver during a screening study for FAP. A colonoscopy and gastroendoscopy revealed numerous adenomatous polyps without carcinoma. The patient underwent a total colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis and hepatic posterior sectoriectomy. The pathological findings of the liver tumor were compatible with HCA. The resected specimen of the colon revealed multiple colonic adenomatous polyps. Examination of genetic alteration revealed a germ-line mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Inactivation of the second APC allele was not found. Other genetic alterations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha and β-catenin gene, which are reported to be associated with HCA, were not detected. Although FAP is reported to be complicated with various neoplasias in extracolic organs, only six cases of HCA associated with FAP, including the present case, have been reported. Additional reports will establish the precise mechanisms of HCA development in FAP patients.",

    "Abstract": "PTEN is a major tumor suppressor gene that encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase with high sequence similarity to the cytoskeletal protein tensin. PTEN may be involved in the formation and disassembly of focal adhesion and affect cell migration. In the present study, PTEN expression plasmid was constructed and transfected into the hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 to analyze the alterations of cell motility and FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. It was observed that the overexpression of PTEN gene significantly inhibited cell motility on extracellular matrix (Fn), and the cell migration on fibronectin was reduced by 35%. Similarly, at 30-min and 60-min, the cell spreading on Fn but not on polylysine was inhibited by 29% and 26% respectively. The data obtained from immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses showed that the overexpression of PTEN did not affect FAK expression but resulted in a decrease in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. The level of FAK phosphorylation was inversely correlated with the level of PTEN protein in three cell lines. It was also found that the overexpression of PTEN led to growth inhibition, with the number of cells in S phase reduced by 16%. These results indicate that PTEN exerts its tumor-suppressive effects on hepatocellular carcinoma cells through the inhibition of cell motility and cell cycle progression.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) has been shown to be essential for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we have found that HBx causes the progression of liver cancer through down-expression of PTEN, known as a tumor suppressor gene (1). The prognosis for HCC depends mainly on the clinicopathological characteristic regarding invasion and metastasis. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 has been implicated as playing an important role in HCC invasion and metastasis. We previously reported that HBV infection increased the invasiveness of hepatocytes and HCC cells through the transcriptional activation of MMP-9 (2). The HBx was shown to activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) signal cascade, which is essential for activation of transcription factors such as activating protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. In this study, we show that the HBx protein stimulates the activities of the PI-3K-Akt/ protein kinase B (PKB) as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) in HBx-transfected cells. Furthermore, we have shown that enhanced expression of MMP-9 in HBx-transfected cells mediated by not only activation of AP-1 transcriptional activity through ERKs pathway but also activation of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity through PI-3K-AKT/PKB pathway, and was associated with the invasive potential. However, treatment with U0126 (known as the ERKs inhibitor) or wortmannin (known as the PI-3K inhibitor), but not SB203580 (known as the p38 MAPK inhibitor), markedly inhibited the expression of MMP-9 induced by HBx in HBx-transfected cells. Seemingly, the invasiveness of HBx-transfected cells was decreased by treating with U0126 or wortmannin, but not SB203580. These results clearly suggest that the HBx contributed to the transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 through the ERKs and PI-3K-AKT/PKB pathway, and increased an invasive potential of cells.",

    "Abstract": "The PTEN gene (phosphatase and tensin homologous on chromosome 10) is frequently mutated or deleted in a number of malignancies including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We reported previously that the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein, known to be a causative agent in the formation of HCC, activates insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) expression through Sp1 phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In this report we demonstrate that the PTEN effect on HBx induced IGF-II activation in a hepatoma cell line. Expression of PTEN and IGF-II was inversely related in different hepatoma cell lines. PTEN expression induced decreased Sp1 DNA binding by dephosphorylating Sp1 and interfered with transcriptional transactivation of IGF-II by HBx in hepatoma cells. The protein phosphatase activity was involved in PTEN downregulation of IGF-II transcription through downregulation of MAPK, MAPK kinase phosphorylation and PKC translocation. Our data suggest that PTEN blocks Sp1 phosphorylation in response to HBx, by inactivating PKC, MAPK and MAPK kinase which eventually downregulate IGF-II expression, during the formation of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Elevated liver enzymes are a common scenario encountered by physicians in clinical practice. For many physicians, however, evaluation of such a problem in patients presenting with no symptoms can be challenging. Evidence supporting a standardized approach to evaluation is lacking. Although alterations of liver enzymes could be a normal physiological phenomenon in certain cases, it may also reflect potential liver injury in others, necessitating its further assessment and management. In this article, we provide a guide to primary care clinicians to interpret abnormal elevation of liver enzymes in asymptomatic patients using a step-wise algorithm. Adopting a schematic approach that classifies enzyme alterations on the basis of pattern (hepatocellular, cholestatic and isolated hyperbilirubinemia), we review an approach to abnormal alteration of liver enzymes within each section, the most common causes of enzyme alteration, and suggest initial investigations.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor suppressor PTEN gene maps to chromosome 10q23.3 and encodes a dual specificity phosphatase. Mutations of this gene had been found in a variety of human tumors. In the present study, we analyzed the structure and expression of the PTEN gene in 34 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and two hepatoma cell lines. We found neither homozygous nor hemizygous deletions in these samples. We, however, found point mutations in 4 of the 34 tissue samples. Five of ten hepatocellular carcinoma tissues showed reduced PTEN expression at mRNA level. HepG2 and SMMC-7721 hepatoma cells showed decreased PTEN expression at both mRNA and protein levels compared with immortalized L02 hepatic cells. PTEN mRNA in SMMC-7721 hepatoma cells could be reduced by TGF-betaI treatment. We also found that the phosphorylation levels of FAK in both of the hepatoma cell lines were higher than that in L02 hepatic cells. Transient expression of the PTEN gene in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 hepatoma cells resulted in decreased FAK phosphorylation. The level of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation appeared to be inversely correlated with the level of the PTEN protein. In summary, our results indicated that the function of the PTEN gene in hepatocarcinomas may be impaired mainly through point mutations and expression deficiency and that the defect of PTEN in tumor cells could alter the phosphorylation of FAK.",

Methods: SMMC-7721 cells were transfected with GFP plasmids containing wild-type PTEN or phosphatase inactivating mutant PTEN (C124A-PTEN) in vitro; The PTEN expression and the phosphorylation levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) were detected by Western blotting; Flow cytometry assay and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to analyze apoptosis in adherent and non-adherent cells. Results: Compared with the control, PTEN expression in the cells transfected with wild-type PTEN increased to 248%, while the phosphorylation level of FAK and Akt decreased 65.2% and 89.1%, respectively; and the anoikis percentage increased from 9.5% to 31.3%. In the cells transfected with C124A-PTEN, neither the phosphorylation of FAK and Akt nor the anoikis percentage had obviously changed, although the PTEN expression enhanced dramatically in comparison with the control. Conclusion: Through its phosphatase activity, tumor suppressor gene PTEN can suppress the phosphorylation of FAK and Akt, and induce anoikis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is a genetic disease. The unstable genome of cancer cells causes tumour progression through multiple alterations in suppressor and promoter genes, leading to loss of homeostatic and gain of oncogenic functions. Invasion is the critical step in the acquisition of malignancy. It implicates a continuous molecular conversation of the cancer cells with other cells and with the extracellular matrix in which adhesion molecules are crucial. One of these, E-cadherin, is discussed in the present review. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that forms a complex with cytoplasmic proteins, termed catenins because they link E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton. E-cadherin/catenin-mediated intercellular adhesion and communication is mainly homophylic homotypic. There is compelling evidence from experiments in vitro as well as in vivo to accept that the E-cadherin/catenin complex acts as an invasion suppressor. The mechanism of this action is not only through cell-cell adhesion but also through transduction of signals to the cell's motility system. In the replication error positive human colon cancer cell line HCT-8, the alpha E-catenin gene CTNNA1 is an invasion suppressor gene. Here, the transition from the non-invasive to the invasive state was prevented by introduction into the unstable non-invasive cells of either an extra CTNNA1 or a wild type hMSH6 mismatch repair gene. beta-catenin also participates at a complex which comprises the adenomatous polyposis cancer protein APC. In colorectal cancer, mutation of either APC or beta-catenin is oncogenic. Downregulation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex may occur in several ways amongst which are gene mutations, methylation of 5'CpG dinucleotides within the promotor region of E-cadherin, tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin, cell surface expression of proteoglycans sterically hindering E-cadherin and proteolytic release of fragments from the extracellular part of E-cadherin. Upregulation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex has been realized with a series of agents, some of which can be used therapeutically. In most human gastrointestinal cancers the E-cadherin/catenin or related complexes are disturbed and this underscores their pivotal role in the progression of these tumours. Mutations of the E-cadherin gene, including germline mutations, occur in diffuse gastric carcinoma, CpG methylation around the promotor region of E-cadherin in hepatocellular carcinomas and mutations of the APC tumour suppressor gene or in the beta-catenin oncogene in most colorectal cancers. The literature agrees about the disturbance of immunohistochemical patterns of E-cadherin and catenin expression in gastrointestinal cancers. Conflicting opinions do, however, exist about the prognostic value of such immunohistochemical aberrations. We doubt that immunohistochemistry of E-cadherin or catenins add prognostic value to the already used histological grading systems. In our opinion the major benefit from understanding of the E-cadherin/catenin-mediated pathways of invasion will be the development of new anti-invasive treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor complexity and intratumor heterogeneity contribute to subclonal diversity. Despite advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics, detecting rare mutations in primary tumors and metastases contributing to subclonal diversity is a challenge for precision genomics. Here, in order to identify rare mutations, we adapted a recently described epithelial reprograming assay for short-term propagation of epithelial cells from primary and metastatic tumors. Using this approach, we expanded minor clones and obtained epithelial cell-specific DNA/RNA for quantitative NGS analysis. Comparative Ampliseq Comprehensive Cancer Panel sequence analyses were performed on DNA from unprocessed breast tumor and tumor cells propagated from the same tumor. We identified previously uncharacterized mutations present only in the cultured tumor cells, a subset of which has been reported in brain metastatic but not primary breast tumors. In addition, whole-genome sequencing identified mutations enriched in liver metastases of various cancers, including Notch pathway mutations/chromosomal inversions in 5/5 liver metastases, irrespective of cancer types. Mutations/rearrangements in FHIT, involved in purine metabolism, were detected in 4/5 liver metastases, and the same four liver metastases shared mutations in 32 genes, including mutations of different HLA-DR family members affecting OX40 signaling pathway, which could impact the immune response to metastatic cells. Pathway analyses of all mutated genes in liver metastases showed aberrant tumor necrosis factor and transforming growth factor signaling in metastatic cells. Epigenetic regulators including KMT2C/MLL3 and ARID1B, which are mutated in >50% of hepatocellular carcinomas, were also mutated in liver metastases. Thus, irrespective of cancer types, organ-specific metastases may share common genomic aberrations. Since recent studies show independent evolution of primary tumors and metastases and in most cases mutation burden is higher in metastases than primary tumors, the method described here may allow early detection of subclonal somatic alterations associated with metastatic progression and potentially identify therapeutically actionable, metastasis-specific genomic aberrations.",

A total of 89 HCC samples were analyzed in this study to determine how alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway associate with the carcinogenesis of HCC. beta-catenin immunohistochemistry showed positive nuclear staining in 24 (27.0%) of the 89 HCC samples, indicating the existence of alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway in those 24 HCC samples. Mutations in the beta-catenin, Axin1 and Axin2 genes were detected in 10 (41.7%), 13 (54.2%) and 9 (37.5%) of the 24 beta-catenin-positive samples, respectively, but no mutation was detected in the APC gene.

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: E-cadherin binds to beta-catenin to form the cadherin/catenin complex required for strong cell adhesion. Inactivation of this complex in tumors facilitates invasion into surrounding tissues. Alterations of both proteins have been reported in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). However, the interactions between E-cadherin and beta-catenin in HCC from different geographical groups have not been explored. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in Australian and South African patients with HCC. Methods: DNA was extracted from malignant and non-malignant liver tissue from 37 Australian and 24 South African patients, and from histologically normal liver from 20 transplant donors. Chromosomal instability at 16q22, promoter methylation at E-cadherin, beta-catenin mutations and E-cadherin and beta-catenin protein expression was assessed using loss of heterozygosity, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: Loss of heterozygosity at 16q22 was prevalent in South African HCC patients (50%vs 11%; P < 0.05, chi(2)). In contrast, E-cadherin promoter hypermethylation was common in Australian cases in both malignant (30%vs 13%; P = not significant, chi(2)) and non-malignant liver (57%vs 8%, respectively, P < 0.001, chi(2)). Methylation of non-malignant liver was more likely to be detected in patients over the age of 50 years (P < 0.001, chi(2)), the overall mean age for our cohort of patients. Only one beta-catenin mutation was identified. E-cadherin protein expression was reduced in one HCC, while abnormalities in protein expression were absent in beta-catenin. Conclusion: Contrary to previous observations in HCC from other countries, neither E-cadherin nor beta-catenin appears to play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis in Australian and South African patients with HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid advancements in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, coupled with the dramatic decrease in cost, have made NGS one of the leading approaches applied in cancer research. In addition, it is increasingly used in clinical practice for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Somatic (cancer‑only) single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) are the simplest classes of mutation, however, their identification in whole exome sequencing data is complicated by germline polymorphisms, tumor heterogeneity and errors in sequencing and analysis. An increasing number of software and methodological guidelines are being published for the analysis of sequencing data. Usually, the algorithms of MuTect, VarScan and Genome Analysis Toolkit are applied to identify the variants. However, one of these algorithms alone results in incomplete genomic information. To address this issue, the present study developed a systematic pipeline for analyzing the whole exome sequencing data of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a combination of the three algorithms, named the three‑caller pipeline. Application of the three‑caller pipeline to the whole exome data of HCC, improved the detection of true positive mutations and a total of 75 tumor‑specific somatic variants were identified. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the mutations in the genes encoding cell adhesion and regulation of Ras GTPase activity. This pipeline provides an effective approach to identify variants from NGS data for subsequent functional analyses.",

    "Abstract": "The expression of mutant forms of proteins (e.g., oncogenes and tumor suppressors) has implications in cancer biology and clinical practice. Initial efforts have been made to characterize the transcription of tumor-mutated alleles; however, few studies have been reported to link tumor-mutated alleles to proteomics. We aimed to characterize the transcriptional and translational patterns of tumor-mutated alleles. We performed whole-exome sequencing, RNA-seq, and proteome profiling in a hyper-mutated patient of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the patient as a model, we show that only a small proportion of tumor-mutated alleles were expressed. In this case, 42% and 3.5% of the tumor-mutated alleles were identified to be transcribed and translated, respectively. Compared with genes with germline variations or without mutations, somatic mutations significantly reduced protein expression abundance. Using the transcriptional and translational patterns of tumor-mutated alleles, we classified the mutations into four types, and only one type may be associated with the liver cancer and lead to hepatocarcinogenesis in the patient. Our results demonstrate how tumor-mutated alleles are transcribed and translated, and how the expression enables the classification of somatic mutations that cause cancer. Leveraging multiple 'omics' datasets provides a new avenue for understanding patient-specific mutations that underlie carcinogenesis.",

Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefits of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or TACE combined with percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) and the long-term survival rate of MHCC patients treated with these techniques. Patients and methods: A retrospective study was performed using data involving 102 MHCC patients admitted to the Second Hospital of Nanjing from September 2010 to August 2015. The median interval between treatments and overall survival (OS) was hierarchically analyzed using log-rank tests. Multivariate analysis was done using Cox regression model analysis. Results: The median survival time of MHCC patients was 3 months (range, 1-10 months) in the palliative group, 3 months (range, 1-39 months) in the TACE group, and 7.5 months (range, 3-30 months) in the TACE-PMCT group (P=0.038).

In addition, TACE sessions had positive correlation with the survival time of MHCC patients (rho = 0.462, P<0.001). TACE treatment more than three times (HR =0.145, P<0.001) was an independent predictor of the survival of MHCC patients, which was identified by the Cox regression model analysis. Conclusions: These results indicated that TACE-PMCT treatment in MHCC patients had advantages in prolonging OS and improving liver function. Multiple TACE treatments might be a suitable treatment for the MHCC patients.",

    "Abstract": "The MET protooncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase identified as the receptor of a polypeptide known as hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. We performed PCR-based single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing analysis of the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene (exon 15-19) in 75 primary liver cancers. Three missense mutations were detected exclusively in 10 childhood hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), while no mutations were detected in 16 adult HCCs, 21 cholangiocarcinomas, or 28 hepatoblastomas. The extremely short incubation period from hepatitis B virus infection to the genesis of childhood HCC as compared with the adult HCC suggests that there may be an additional mechanism that accelerates the carcinogenesis of childhood HCC. Our results indicate that mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene may be involved in the acceleration of the carcinogenesis in childhood HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS), which incorporates fixed criteria, and the Likert scale (LS), which mainly depends on an overall impression in liver lesion diagnosis. Material and methods: Diagnostic data of 110 hepatic nodules in 103 high-risk patients for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were included. Data including diameter, arterial hyperenhancement, washout, and capsule were reviewed by 2 readers using LI-RADS and LS (range, score 1-5). Inter-reader agreement (IRA), intraclass agreement (ICA), and diagnostic performance were determined by Fleiss, Cohen's k, and logistic regression, respectively. Results: There were 53 triphasic enhanced computed tomography (CT) and 50 dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) examinations. Overall, IRA was excellent (k = 0.898). IRA was good for arterial hyperenhancement (k = 0.705), washout (k = 0.763), and capsule (k = 0.771) and excellent for diameter (k = 0.981) and tumour embolus (k = 0.927). Overall, ICA between LI-RADS and LS was fair 0.32; ICA was good for scores of 1 (k = 0.682), fair for scores of 2 (k = 0.36), moderate for scores of 5 (k = 0.52), but no agreement was found for scores of 3 (k = -0.059) and 4 (k = -0.022). LIRADS produced relatively high accuracy (87.3% vs. 80%), relatively low sensitivity (84.3% vs. 98%), and significantly higher specificity (89.83% vs. 64.4%) and positive likelihood ratio (+LR: 8.29 vs. 2.75) compared to LS approach. Conclusions: LI-RADS revealed higher diagnostic accuracy as compared to LS with statistical proof higher specificity and +LR showing its ability to foretell malignancy in high-risk patients. We recommend the practical application of the LI-RADS system in the detection and treatment response monitoring of patients with HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Interplay of pioneer transcription factor forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and estrogen receptor has been implicated in sexual dimorphism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but etiological relevance of its polymorphism was unknown. In the case control study (1152 patients versus1242 controls), we observed significant increase in HCC susceptibility in hepatitis B virus carriers associated with a non-synonymous Thr83Ala variant of FOXA1 (odds ratio [OR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.48, for Ala83-containing genotype, after validation in an independent population with 933 patients versus 1030 controls), a tightly linked (CGC)5/6or7 repeat polymorphism at its promoter (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.10-1.60, for (CGC)6or7-repeat-containing genotype), and their combined haplotype (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.24-1.81, for (CGC)6or7-Ala83 haplotype). The susceptible FOXA1-Ala83 impairs its interaction with ERα, attenuates transactivation toward some of their dual target genes, such as type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase, UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B17 and sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, but correlates with strengthened cellular expression of α-fetoprotein (AFP) and elevated AFP serum concentration in HCC patients (n = 1096). The susceptible FOXA1 cis-variant with (CGC)6or7 repeat strengthens the binding to transcription factor early growth response 1 and enhances promoter activity and gene expression. Evolutionary population genetics analyses with public datasets reveal significant population differentiation and unique haplotype structure of the derived protective FOXA1-Thr83 and suggest that it may have undergone positive natural selection in Chinese population. These findings epidemiologically highlight the functional significance of FOXA1-ERα transcriptional program and regulatory network in liver cancer development.",

    "Abstract": "Many of the type 2 diabetes loci identified through genome-wide association studies localize to non-protein-coding intronic and intergenic regions and likely contain variants that regulate gene transcription. The CDC123/CAMK1D type 2 diabetes association signal on chromosome 10 spans an intergenic region between CDC123 and CAMK1D and also overlaps the CDC123 3'UTR. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the association signal, we used open chromatin, histone modifications and transcription factor ChIP-seq data sets from type 2 diabetes-relevant cell types to identify SNPs overlapping predicted regulatory regions. Two regions containing type 2 diabetes-associated variants were tested for enhancer activity using luciferase reporter assays. One SNP, rs11257655, displayed allelic differences in transcriptional enhancer activity in 832/13 and MIN6 insulinoma cells as well as in human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The rs11257655 risk allele T showed greater transcriptional activity than the non-risk allele C in all cell types tested. Using electromobility shift and supershift assays we demonstrated that the rs11257655 risk allele showed allele-specific binding to FOXA1 and FOXA2. We validated FOXA1 and FOXA2 enrichment at the rs11257655 risk allele using allele-specific ChIP in human islets. These results suggest that rs11257655 affects transcriptional activity through altered binding of a protein complex that includes FOXA1 and FOXA2, providing a potential molecular mechanism at this GWAS locus.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as sorafenib and lenvatinib, can improve the outcomes of HCC patients. Nevertheless, chemoresistance has become a major hurdle in the effective treatment of HCC. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including mircoRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have been demonstrated to participate in the onset and progression of HCC. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence have indicated that ncRNAs also play a pivotal role in HCC drug resistance. ncRNAs can regulate drug efflux and metabolism, glucose metabolism, cellular death pathways, and malignant characteristics in HCC. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for ncRNA-mediated drug resistance in HCC will provide new opportunities for improving the treatment of HCC. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms by which ncRNAs regulate HCC chemoresistance, as well as their potential clinical implications in overcoming HCC chemoresistance.",

    "Abstract": "The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs) are a family of proteins that bind IGF-I and IGF-II and modulate their biological activities. IGFBP-1 is distinctive among the IGFBPs in its rapid regulation in response to metabolic and hormonal changes. The synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, increases IGFBP-1 mRNA abundance and gene transcription in rat liver and in H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells. A glucocorticoid response element (GRE) located at nucleotide (nt) -91/-77 is required for dexamethasone to stimulate rat IGFBP-1 promoter activity in transient transfection assays in H4-II-E cells. In addition to the GRE, three accessory regulatory sites [a putative hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) site (nt -62/-50), an insulin-response element (nt -108/-99), and an upstream site (nt -252/-236)] are involved in dexamethasone stimulation under some, but not all, circumstances. The present study begins to address the mechanism by which transcription factors bound to the putative HNF-1 site act synergistically with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) bound to the GRE. In gel shift assays, HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta in H4-II-E extracts bind to the palindromic HNF-1 site. Both half-sites are required. Overexpression of HNF-1beta enhances dexamethasone-stimulated promoter activity. Both the HNF-1 site and the GRE must be intact for stimulation to occur. By contrast, overexpression of HNF-1alpha does not enhance dexamethasone-stimulated promoter activity, although, as also observed with overexpression of HNF-1beta, it inhibits basal promoter activity. Thus, the synergistic effects of HNF-1beta and the GR on dexamethasone-stimulated promoter activity require that they are bound to the HNF-1 site and the GRE, respectively, and may involve protein-protein interactions between the transcription factors, or between them and the basal transcription machinery or a steroid receptor coactivator. Synergy between the ubiquitously expressed GR and HNF-1, which is developmentally regulated and expressed in a limited number of tissues, provides a possible mechanism for tissue- and development-specific regulation of glucocorticoid action.",

    "Abstract": "Aims/hypothesis: To explain the mechanisms whereby mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene cause insulin secretory defects. Methods: A truncated mutant HNF-1alpha (HNF-1alpha288t) was overexpressed in hepatoma cells (HepG2) and murine insulinoma cells (MIN6) using a recombinant adenovirus system and expression of the HNF-1alpha target genes and insulin secretion were examined. Results: Expression of phenylalanine hydroxylase and alpha1-antitrypsin genes, the target genes of HNF-1alpha, was suppressed in HepG2 cells by overexpression of HNF-1alpha288t. In MIN6 cells, overexpression of HNF-1alpha288t did not change insulin secretion stimulated by glucose (5 mmol/l and 25 mmol/l) or leucine (20 mmol/l). Potentiation of insulin secretion by arginine (20 mmol/l, in the presence of 5 mmol/l or 25mmol/l glucose) was, however, reduced (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.027, respectively). Similarly reduced responses were observed when stimulated with homoarginine. Expression of the cationic amino acid transporter-2 was not reduced and insulin secretory response to membrane depolarization by 50 mmol/l KCl was intact. Conclusion/interpretation: The HNF-1alpha288 t, which is structurally similar to the mutant HNF-1alpha expressed from the common MODY3 allele, P291fsinsC, exerts a dominant negative effect. Suppression of HNF-1alpha in MIN6 cells severely impaired potentiation of insulin secretion by arginine, whereas glucose-stimulated and leucine-stimulated insulin secretion was intact. Our findings delineate the complex nature of beta-cell failure in patients with MODY3. This cell model will be useful for further investigation of the mechanism of insulin secretory defects in these patients.",

    "Abstract": "Beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) is a plasma glycoprotein primarily synthesized in the liver. The interindividual variability of beta2-GPI expression in subjects with various metabolic syndromes and disease states suggests that it may have clinical importance. However, the regulation of beta2-GPI gene expression has not been clarified. To gain more insight into the control of beta2-GPI gene expression, we cloned the 4.1-kb 5'-flanking region and characterized the proximal promoter of the beta2- GPI gene in this study. Cis -acting elements required for beta2-GPI promoter activity were identified with transient transfection assays in the hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 and in non-hepatic HeLa cells. Serial deletion analyses of the beta2-GPI 5'-flanking sequence revealed that the region from -197 to +7 had strong promoter activity in hepatoma cells but not in HeLa cells. Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis of putative cis -elements within this region showing an atypical TATA box and a HNF-1 (hepatic nuclear factor-1) element were both essential for the beta2-GPI promoter activity. Subsequent gel mobility shift assays confirmed the interaction of HNF-1alpha with the HNF-1 site residing downstream of the TATA box. Co-transfection of beta2-GPI promoter-luciferase vector with HNF-1alpha expression vector in Huh7 and HNF-1-deficient HeLa cells demonstrated the transactivation effect of HNF-1alpha on beta2-GPI promoter activity. In addition, overexpression of HNF-1alpha enhanced the endogenous beta2-GPI expression. These results suggest that the atypical TATA box and HNF-1 cis-element are critical for beta2-GPI transcription and HNF-1alpha may play an important role in cell-specific regulation of beta2-GPI gene expression.",

    "Abstract": "An elevated plasma fibrinogen level is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, an understanding of the regulation of fibrinogen expression is important. Inflammation and genetic variation of the fibrinogen beta gene regulate plasma fibrinogen levels, and there are indications that inflammation and genetic variation interact. The aim of our study was to gain more understanding of the regulation of the inflammatory response of the fibrinogen beta gene and to determine the effects of genetic variation. Luciferase reporter gene assays in hepatoma cells, mutation analysis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the fibrinogen beta promoter. We identified a hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3) site located just upstream of previously identified interleukin-6 (IL6)-responsive sequences. This HNF-3 site is essential for a full response of the promoter to IL6, which is a new function for HNF-3. The activity of the CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein site (located 18 nucleotides downstream of the HNF-3 site and important to the IL6 response) depends on the integrity of the HNF-3 site and vice versa, explaining the necessity of HNF-3 in the IL6 response of the fibrinogen beta promoter. Furthermore, small interfering RNA to HNF-3 reduces the fibrinogen beta mRNA levels. The rare T allele of the -148C/T polymorphism, which is present between the binding sites of HNF-3 and CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein, interferes with this mechanism, and this polymorphism is in our assay system the only genetic determinant of IL6-induced promoter activity among six polymorphisms in the fibrinogen beta promoter.",

    "Abstract": "In previous studies we used transgenic mice or recombinant adenovirus infection to increase hepatic expression of forkhead box A2 (FoxA2, previously called hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta [HNF-3beta]), which caused diminished hepatocyte glycogen levels and reduced expression of glucose homeostasis genes. Because this diminished expression of FoxA2 target genes was associated with reduced levels of the Cut-Homeodomain HNF-6 transcription factor, we conducted the present study to determine whether there is a functional interaction between HNF-6 and FoxA2. Human hepatoma (HepG2) cotransfection assays demonstrated that HNF-6 synergistically stimulated FoxA2 but not FoxA1 or FoxA3 transcriptional activity, and protein-binding assays showed that this protein interaction required the HNF-6 Cut-Homeodomain and FoxA2 winged-helix DNA binding domains. Furthermore, we show that the HNF-6 Cut-Homeodomain sequences were sufficient to synergistically stimulate FoxA2 transcriptional activation by recruiting the p300/CBP coactivator proteins. This was supported by the fact that FoxA2 transcriptional synergy with HNF-6 was dependent on retention of the HNF-6 Cut domain LXXLL sequence, which mediated recruitment of the p300/CBP proteins. Moreover, cotransfection and DNA binding assays demonstrated that increased FoxA2 levels caused a decrease in HNF-6 transcriptional activation of the glucose transporter 2 (Glut-2) promoter by interfering with the binding of HNF-6 to its target DNA sequence. These data suggest that at a FoxA-specific site, HNF-6 serves as a coactivator protein to enhance FoxA2 transcription, whereas at an HNF-6-specific site, FoxA2 represses HNF-6 transcription by inhibiting HNF-6 DNA binding activity. This is the first reported example of a liver-enriched transcription factor (HNF-6) functioning as a coactivator protein to potentiate the transcriptional activity of another liver factor, FoxA2.",

    "Abstract": "Limitation of cultured rat hepatoma cells for an essential amino acid results in a specific decrease in expression of several genes that are preferentially expressed in the liver, including the serum albumin and transthyretin genes. In the work presented here, we examined whether the coordinate repression of these genes is caused by decreased activity of one or more of the liver-enriched transcription factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1), HNF-3, HNF-4 or C/EBP. To address this question, HepG2 human hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing multiple copies of individual transcription factor binding sites. Limitation for an essential amino acid resulted in specific repression of a construct in which luciferase expression was directed by HNF-1. A single HNF-1 binding site located adjacent to the TATA box plays a major role in transcription directed by the serum albumin promoter in transient transfection assays. Amino acid limitation of cells transfected with an albumin promoter/luciferase reporter construct resulted in specific repression of promoter activity. In addition, bacterial methylation or site-directed mutagenesis of the HNF-1 binding site in the albumin proximal promoter region eliminated the regulation of an albumin promoter-luciferase reporter construct under conditions of amino acid limitation. These results demonstrated that the HNF-1 binding site played a major role in regulation of the albumin promoter by amino acid availability. Deletion analysis of the albumin promoter confirmed regulation through the HNF-1 binding site and also identified a second amino acid regulatory element in the upstream region of the albumin promoter, which has been shown previously to contain a functional binding site for HNF-3. The repression of albumin promoter and HNF-1 reporter constructs in amino acid-limited cells occurred without a change in the DNA binding activity of HNF-1. Moreover, HNF-3 DNA binding activity was also not decreased in amino acid-limited cells. These results suggest that the regulation of transcription by amino acids occurs at the level of transcriptional activation by HNF-1 and HNF-3, rather than by alteration of the DNA binding activity of either factor.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha) (nuclear receptor 2A1) is an essential regulator of hepatocyte differentiation and function. Genetic and molecular evidence suggests that the tissue-restricted expression of HNF-4alpha is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. As a step toward understanding the molecular mechanism involved in the transcriptional regulation of the human HNF-4alpha gene, we cloned and analyzed a 12.1-kb fragment of its upstream region. Major DNase I-hypersensitive sites were found at the proximal promoter, the first intron, and the more-upstream region comprising kb -6.5, -8.0, and -8.8. By the use of reporter constructs, we found that the proximal-promoter region was sufficient to drive high levels of hepatocyte-specific transcription in transient-transfection assays. DNase I footprint analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift experiments revealed binding sites for HNF-1alpha and -beta, Sp-1, GATA-6, and HNF-6. High levels of HNF-4alpha promoter activity were dependent on the synergism between either HNF-1alpha and HNF-6 or HNF-1beta and GATA-6, which implies that at least two alternative mechanisms may activate HNF-4alpha gene transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with human hepatoma cells showed stable association of HNF-1alpha, HNF-6, Sp-1, and COUP-TFII with the promoter. The last factor acts as a repressor via binding to a newly identified direct repeat 1 (DR-1) sequence of the human promoter, which is absent in the mouse homologue. We present evidence that this sequence is a bona fide retinoic acid response element and that HNF-4alpha expression is upregulated in vivo upon retinoic acid signaling.",

    "Abstract": "Organic anion transporters (OATs) are anion exchangers that transport small hydrophilic anions and diuretics, antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral nucleoside analogs, and antitumor drugs across membrane barriers of epithelia of diverse organs. Three OATs are present in human liver: OAT2, OAT5, and OAT7. Given that hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α (HNF-1α) has previously been shown to regulate the expression of several hepatocellular transporter genes, we investigated whether the liver-specific human OAT genes are also regulated by HNF-1α. Short interfering RNAs targeting HNF-1α reduced endogenous expression of OAT5 and OAT7, but not OAT2, in human liver-derived Huh7 cells. Luciferase reporter gene constructs containing the OAT5 (SLC22A10) and OAT7 (SLC22A9) promoter regions were transactivated by HNF-1α in HepG2 cells. Two putative HNF-1α binding elements in the proximal OAT5 promoter, located at nucleotides -68/-56 and -173/-160, and one element in the OAT7 promoter, located at nucleotides -14/-2 relative to the transcription start site, were shown to bind HNF-1α in electromobility shift assays, and these promoter regions also interacted with HNF-1α in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. A correlation between HNF-1α and OAT5 (r = 0.134, P < 0.05) or OAT7 (r = 0.461, P < 0.001) mRNA expression levels in surgical liver biopsies from 75 patients further supported an important role of HNF-1α in the regulation of OAT gene expression.",

    "Abstract": "A heterozygous T-->C transition was detected in the putative promoter region of the protein C (PROC) gene in a patient with type I protein C deficiency and a history of recurrent venous thrombosis. This mutation occurred 14 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site and within a sequence strongly homologous to the consensus binding site for the liver-enriched transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1). Transfection experiments demonstrated that a CAT reporter gene construct containing 626 bp of the putative PROC gene promoter was capable of driving CAT expression in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Levels of CAT expression from constructs bearing the mutation were found to be drastically reduced by comparison with the wild-type, consistent with the reduced plasma protein C antigen levels observed in the patient. Gel retardation and cotransfection experiments demonstrated that the mutation abolished both the binding and the transactivating ability of HNF-1 observed with the wild-type PROC gene promoter. Further, the ability of the mutation to disrupt HNF-1 binding appears to be a function not only of the nature of the nucleotide substitution and its position within the recognition sequence, but also of the relative affinity of the wild-type binding site for HNF-1. This analysis is therefore indicative of a vital role for HNF-1 in the expression of the PROC gene in vivo. Taken together with the identification of a human hepatoma cell line which contains HNF-1 but which does not express protein C, these findings are consistent with the view that HNF-1 is necessary although not sufficient for PROC gene expression in the liver.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is affecting more people globally. Indeed, NAFLD is a spectrum of metabolic dysfunctions that can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (NAFLD-HCC). This development can occur in a non-cirrhotic liver and thus, often lack clinical surveillance. The aim of this study was to develop non-invasive surveillance method for NAFLD-HCC. Methods: Using comprehensive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry, we investigated 1,295 metabolites in serum from 249 patients. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated for all detected metabolites and used to establish their diagnostic potential. Logistic regression analysis was used to establish the diagnostic score. Findings: We show that NAFLD-HCC is characterised by a complete rearrangement of the serum lipidome, which distinguishes NAFLD-HCC from non-cancerous individuals and other HCC patients. We used machine learning to build a diagnostic model for NAFLD-HCC. We quantified predictive metabolites and developed the NAFLD-HCC Diagnostic Score (NHDS), presenting superior diagnostic potential compared to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Patients' metabolic landscapes show a progressive depletion in unsaturated fatty acids and acylcarnitines during transformation. Upregulation of fatty acid transporters in NAFLD-HCC tumours contribute to fatty acid depletion in the serum. Interpretation: NAFLD-HCC patients can be efficiently distinguished by serum metabolic alterations from the healthy population and from HCC patients related to other aetiologies (alcohol and viral hepatitis). Our model can be used for non-invasive surveillance of individuals with metabolic syndrome(s), allowing for early detection of NAFLD-HCC. Therefore, serum metabolomics may provide valuable insight to monitor patients at risk, including morbidly obese, diabetics, and NAFLD patients. Funding: The funding sources for this study had no role in study design, data collection, data analyses, interpretation or writing of the report as it is presented herein.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Besides more common sites such as lung or peritoneum, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can metastatize to rare sites. We report herein a new metastatic site of HCC: the nail-bed. We also review other recently reported rare site HCC metastases (RSHM). Case report: A 66-year-old woman with a 12-year history of resected-stage IA HCC who later presented lung, spleen and brain metastases treated with surgery, systemic therapies (sorafenib, sunitinib, capecitabine) and radiotherapy. The patient was referred to us because of a painful and rapidly evolving mass in the nail-bed of the left thumb. Biopsy confirmed nail-bed HCC metastasis, and the finger was amputated. The patient died few weeks later. Conclusion: This case was an opportunity for us to review RSHM. This type of metastasis seems to be an early event, in the context of advanced stage HCC with elevated protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA II). The Lee nomogram is useful in detecting patients at high risk of developing RSHM. We would suggest insisting on systemic treatment in these metastatic patients although overall survival after RSHM diagnosis is poor.",

    "Abstract": "During the last 5 decades, liver transplantation has witnessed rapid development in terms of both technical and pharmacologic advances. Since their discovery, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) have remained the standard of care for immunosuppression therapy in liver transplantation, improving both patient and graft survival. However, adverse events, particularly posttransplant nephrotoxicity, associated with long-term CNI use have necessitated the development of alternate treatment approaches. These include combination therapy with a CNI and the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor mycophenolic acid and use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Everolimus, a 40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl) derivative of mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, has a distinct pharmacokinetic profile. Several studies have assessed the role of everolimus in liver transplant recipients in combination with CNI reduction or as a CNI withdrawal strategy. The efficacy of everolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy has been demonstrated in both de novo and maintenance liver transplant recipients. A pivotal study in 719 de novo liver transplant recipients formed the basis of the recent approval of everolimus in combination with steroids and reduced-dose tacrolimus in liver transplantation. In this study, everolimus introduced at 30 days posttransplantation in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus (exposure reduced by 39%) showed comparable efficacy (composite efficacy failure rate of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death) and achieved superior renal function as early as month 1 and maintained it over 2 years versus standard exposure tacrolimus. This review provides an overview of the efficacy and safety of everolimus-based regimens in liver transplantation in the de novo and maintenance settings, as well as in special populations such as patients with hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence, hepatitis C virus-positive patients, and pediatric transplant recipients. We also provide an overview of ongoing studies and discuss potential expansion of the role for everolimus in these settings.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: To compare the difference of liver sparing and dose escalation between three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and helical tomotherapy (HT) for hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients and methods: Sixteen unresectable HCC patients were enrolled in this study. First, some evaluation factors of 3DCRT, IMRT, and HT plans were calculated with prescription dose at 50 Gy/25 fractions. Then, the doses were increased using HT or IMRT independently until either the plans reached 70 Gy or any normal tissue reached the dose limit according to quantitative analysis of normal tissue effects in the clinic criteria. Results: The conformal index of 3DCRT was lower than that of IMRT (P<0.001) or HT (P<0.001), and the homogeneity index of 3DCRT was higher than that of IMRT (P<0.001) or HT (P<0.001). HT took the longest treatment time (P<0.001). For V 50% (fraction of normal liver treated to at least 50% of the isocenter dose) of the normal liver, there was a significant difference: 3DCRT > IMRT > HT (P<0.001). HT had a lower D mean (mean dose) and V 20 (V n, the percentage of organ volume receiving ≥n Gy) of liver compared with 3DCRT (P=0.005 and P=0.005, respectively) or IMRT (P=0.508 and P=0.007, respectively). D mean of nontarget normal liver and V 30 of liver were higher for 3DCRT than IMRT (P=0.005 and P=0.005, respectively) or HT (P=0.005 and P=0.005, respectively). Seven patients in IMRT (43.75%) and nine patients in HT (56.25%) reached the isodose 70 Gy, meeting the dose limit of the organs at risk. Conclusion: HT may provide significantly better liver sparing and allow more patients to achieve higher prescription dose in HCC radiotherapy.",

Several species of this family are known to possess indole alkaloids and other classes of secondary metabolites, whereas terpenoids, an inositol and the indole alkaloids harmane-3 acid and braznitidumine have been described in A. nitidum . In the present study, extracts from the wood bark, leaves and branches of this species were prepared for assays against malaria parasites and cytotoxicity testing using human hepatoma and normal monkey kidney cells. The wood bark extracts were active against Plasmodium falciparum and showed a low cytotoxicity in vitro, whereas the leaf and branch extracts and the pure alkaloid braznitidumine were inactive. A crude methanol extract was subjected to acid-base fractionation aimed at obtaining alkaloid-rich fractions, which were active at low concentrations against P. falciparum and in mice infected with and sensitive Plasmodium berghei parasites. Our data validate the antimalarial usefulness of A. nitidum wood bark, a remedy that can most likely help to control malaria. However, the molecules responsible for this antimalarial activity have not yet been identified. Considering their high selectivity index, the alkaloid-rich fractions from the plant bark might be useful in the development of new antimalarials.",

We present a third case of a 77-year-old woman presenting with nausea and jaundice after recent discontinuation of ibrutinib and compare the presentation as well as course of all 3 known cases. The sudden onset of acute hepatotoxicity is idiosyncratic, occurring weeks after starting ibrutinib treatment. Liver biopsies in all cases revealed mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic features. Improvement progressed slowly upon discontinuation of ibrutinib.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Gardner syndrome, a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis, is characterized by colonic polyps that undergo malignant change and benign and malignant extracolonic lesions. Tumors frequently associated with Gardner syndrome include carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, and, in children, hepatoblastoma. The childhood malignancies often precede the appearance of other manifestations by several years. Patients and methods: Two patients are described. Gardner syndrome was diagnosed in a 15-year-old girl with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma after desmoid tumors and colonic polyposis developed. Classic hepatocellular carcinoma was also diagnosed in a 9 1/2-year-old boy with familial adenomatous polyposis. Results: In patient 1, the diagnosis of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma preceded the diagnosis of Gardner syndrome by almost 2 years. The diagnosis was confirmed by identifying a germline mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. This is the first patient reported with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma associated with Gardner syndrome. Patient 2 had a strong family history of familial adenomatous polyposis but no manifestations of Gardner syndrome. He was not tested for the APC mutation. The current literature and previously reported cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with Gardner syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis are reviewed. Conclusions: Because hepatocellular carcinoma is uncommon in the pediatric and adolescent population, it is important to consider the possibility of Gardner syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis in these patients.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To establish a routine procedure for the detection of p53 mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgical resections using the FASAY (functional analysis of separated alleles of p53 on yeast) procedure. Methods: p53 status was analyzed by FASAY and cDNA sequencing in 50 cases of HCC. After the extraction of RNA from the frozen tumor and corresponding normal tissues, reverse transcription RT-PCR was carried out using these samples. The assay can detect mutations of p53 mRNA between codons 67 and 347 by the DNA-binding activity of the protein and reveal them as red colonies. Results: Of the 50 specimens, 29 (58%) were positive (mutant) by FASAY. Sequencing analysis confirmed that all 29 FASAY positive tumors harbored mutations, and that no mutations were detectable in any FASAY negative tumors. In 29 p53 mutations, 22 mutations were point missense mutation, 5 were deletions and 2 were splicing mutations. A novel splice mutation on splice donor of intron 6 was reported, which could produce two different mRNAs, respectively using the nearest upstream and downstream recessive splice donor sites. Conclusion: FASAY is a sensitive method for detecting the various types of p53 mutations in HCC, suggesting that the yeast functional assay for the detection of p53 mutations may be essential for elucidating their clinical significance.",

    "Abstract": "Recent advances in sequencing technology have allowed us to profile genome-wide mutations of various cancer types, revealing huge heterogeneity of cancer genome variations. However, its heterogeneous landscape of somatic mutations according to liver cancer progression is not fully understood. Here, we profiled the mutations and gene expressions of early and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related with Hepatitis B-viral infection. Integrative analysis was performed with whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiles of the 12 cases of early and advanced HCCs and paired non-tumoral adjacent liver tissues. A total of 293 tumor-specific somatic variants and 202 non-tumoral variants were identified. The tumor-specific variants were found to be enriched at chromosome 1q particularly in the advanced HCC, compared to the non-tumoral variants. Functional enrichment analysis revealed frequent mutations at the genes encoding cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, and cell cycle-related genes. In addition, to elucidate actionable somatic mutations, we performed an integrative analysis of gene mutations and gene expression profiles together. This revealed the 48 mutated genes which were differentially mutated with concomitant gene expression enrichment. Of these, CTNNB1 was found to have a pivotal role in the differential progression of the HCC subgroup. In conclusion, our integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome profiles could provide actionable mutations which might play pivotal roles in the heterogeneous progression of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells initiate a complex signalling pathway, termed the DNA damage response (DDR), which coordinates cell cycle arrest with DNA repair. Studies have shown that oncogene-induced senescence, which provides a barrier to tumour development, involves activation of the DDR. Using a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we have identified 17 factors required for oncogenic BRAF to induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and melanocytes. One of these factors is an F-box protein, FBXO31, a candidate tumour suppressor encoded in 16q24.3, a region in which there is loss of heterozygosity in breast, ovarian, hepatocellular and prostate cancers. Here we study the cellular role of FBXO31, identify its target substrate and determine the basis for its growth inhibitory activity. We show that ectopic expression of FBXO31 acts through a proteasome-directed pathway to mediate the degradation of cyclin D1, an important regulator of progression from G1 to S phase, resulting in arrest in G1. Cyclin D1 degradation results from a direct interaction with FBXO31 and is dependent on the F-box motif of FBXO31 and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr 286, which is known to be required for cyclin D1 proteolysis. The involvement of the DDR in oncogene-induced senescence prompted us to investigate the role of FBXO31 in DNA repair. We find that DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation results in increased FBXO31 levels, which requires phosphorylation of FBXO31 by the DDR-initiating kinase ATM. RNAi-mediated knockdown of FBXO31 prevents cells from undergoing efficient arrest in G1 after gamma-irradiation and markedly increases sensitivity to DNA damage. Finally, we show that a variety of DNA damaging agents all result in a large increase in FBXO31 levels, indicating that induction of FBXO31 is a general response to genotoxic stress. Our results reveal FBXO31 as a regulator of the G1/S transition that is specifically required for DNA damage-induced growth arrest.",

Methods and results: Forty-five hepatoblastomas (HBs), 13 paediatric hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and two hepatocellular malignant neoplasms not otherwise specified (NOS) were chosen for immunohistochemical staining of glypican 3 (GPC3), β-catenin, claudin-1, delta-like protein (DLK), and forkhead box protein G1 (FOXG1). Immunostaining was quantitatively analysed with NIH imagej software coupled with colour deconvolution. Different subtypes of HB and HCC showed distinct staining patterns of GPC3, β-catenin, and claudin-1. Moreover, GPC3, β-catenin and claudin-1 all showed higher expression in classic HCC and embryonal HB than in fetal HB; GPC3 showed complete negativity in small-cell undifferentiated (SCU) HB and fibrolamellar HCC (FLC); β-catenin showed the strongest expression in SCU HB but the weakest expression in FLC. A panel of these three immunomarkers was useful for the diagnosis of hepatocellular malignant neoplasms NOS. The expression of DLK and FOXG1 was inconstant among fetal and embryonal HB and classic HCC. Conclusions: A panel of GPC3, β-catenin and claudin-1 is helpful for differentiating HB subtypes and distinguishing HB from HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Conventional pathological analysis fails to achieve sufficient sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in small nodules. Immunohistochemical staining for glypican 3 (GPC3), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and glutamine synthetase (GS) has been suggested to allow a confident diagnosis but no prospective study has established the diagnostic accuracy of this approach. The aim of this study is to assess prospectively the diagnostic accuracy of a panel of markers (GPC3, HSP70, GS) for the diagnosis of HCC in patients with cirrhosis with a small (5-20 mm) nodule detected by ultrasound screening. Methods: Sixty patients with cirrhosis with a single nodule 5-20 mm newly detected by ultrasound were included in the study. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound, magnetic resonance and fine needle biopsy of the nodule (gold standard) were performed; the biopsy was repeated in case of diagnostic failures. Three consecutive sections of the first biopsy sample with meaningful material were stained with antibodies against GPC3, HSP70 and GS. Results: Forty patients were diagnosed with HCC. The sensitivity and specificity for HCC diagnosis were: GPC3 57.5% and 95%, HSP70 57.5% and 85%, GS 50% and 90%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the different combinations were: GPC3+HSP70 40% and 100%; GPC3+GS 35% and 100%; HSP70+GS 35% and 100%; GPC3+HSP70+GS 25% and 100%. When at least two of the markers were positive (regardless of which), the sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 100%, respectively. Conventional pathological analysis yielded three false negative results, but the addition of this panel only correctly classified one of these cases as HCC. Conclusion: These data within a prospective study establish the clinical usefulness of this panel of markers for the diagnosis of early HCC. However, the panel only slightly increases the diagnostic accuracy in an expert setting.",

In the literature, many factors are associated with higher risk of recurrence, without a clear definition of the best method that could predict this highly lethal event. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoexpression of immunohistochemical markers: HSP70, glypican 3, glutamine synthetase, and beta-catenin, as well as studying their association with tumor characteristics and prognosis of patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC. Methods: We studied 90 patients who underwent liver transplantation from 1998 to 2012. Afterwards we evaluated factors related to survival, tumor recurrence, and the correlation of expression of the immunohistochemical markers. Results: Immunohistochemical marker glutamine synthetase showed a positive trend toward better survival. HSP70-positive patients had a higher prevalence of histologic grade III. Patients with positive glypican 3 showed larger lesions and a higher number with AFP >200 ng/mL. Patients with positive beta-catenin showed larger nodules and more with histologic grade III. The association between beta-catenin and glypican 3 showed positive association with larger nodules. Conclusions: Most of the markers studied had a correlation with at least one of the variables studied, confirming our hypothesis that these markers can indeed assist in assessing the prognosis of patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The identification of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) with mutation in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene encoding for β-catenin is clinically relevant due to a higher risk of malignant transformation. Inflammatory HCA (IHCA) can exhibit β-catenin activation (β-IHCA). We report two cases with multiple IHCA in which focal β-catenin activation has been found in one of the IHCA. In both cases, the diagnosis of IHCA was confirmed on the resected nodules by routine stains, immunohistochemical detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) and molecular biology on frozen material. An additional molecular analysis was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material that showed focal glutamine synthetase (GS) staining, the surrogate marker of β-catenin activation. In case 1, it was a 1.8-cm area within the 7.5 cm IHCA, and in case 2 a small 0.3-cm area within a 1.8 cm resected IHCA located close to a larger IHCA, negative for GS. In both cases, nuclear β-catenin expression and decreased reticulin network were observed in the GS expressing foci, together with cholestasis and diffuse CD34 expression in case 1. Molecular analysis by pyrosequencing on FFPE material using the GS-stained slides as reference to select areas with/without positive staining revealed a CTNNB1 exon 3 mutation restricted to the areas exhibiting both positive GS and CRP expression, whereas wild-type CTNNB1 was found in areas showing only CRP staining. These two cases illustrate focal β-catenin activation that can occur within IHCAs. Additional data are needed to determine if β-catenin mutation is a secondary event in IHCA.",

    "Abstract": "Background/purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the expression of β-catenin and its downstream target glutamine synthetase (GS) in hepatoblastoma (HB), and to evaluate the use of these two markers for diagnosing HB. Methods: Eighteen untreated HBs and 22 HBs resected after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed using β-catenin and GS immunostaining. Results: We detected nuclear β-catenin immunostaining in nearly all untreated HBs, including in fetal and embryonal epithelial components and in mesenchymal elements. We also observed diffuse GS expression in the epithelial component; however, it was frequently absent in embryonal and mesenchymal areas. In HBs resected after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we recognized four histological patterns: fetal, hepatocellular-carcinoma-like, clear-cell, and normal-liver-like. All these patterns displayed diffuse GS expression. Fetal pattern showed diffuse nuclear β-catenin immunostaining. Nuclear β-catenin immunostaining was weak in the hepatocellular-carcinoma-like and clear-cell patterns. In normal-liver-like area, β-catenin expression was only located in the cell membrane. Conclusion: The results suggest that nuclear β-catenin expression and diffuse GS immunostaining are the hallmarks of HB. Although epithelial and mesenchymal components of HB display nuclear β-catenin staining, this expression is attenuated following chemotherapy-induced cell maturation. GS immunostaining is especially useful for the assessment of section margins after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most prevalent cancer and thirdly leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The estimated risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is 15 to 20 times as high among persons infected with HCV as it is among those who are not infected, with most of the excess risk limited to those with advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Glypican3 (GPC3) plays a key role in relation to signaling with growth factors, regulating the proliferative activity of cancer cells. Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia in the mammalian liver. GS was suggested as a specific marker for tracing cell lineage relationships during hepatocarcinogenesis. In normal liver, GS expression is seen in pericentral hepatocytes, but not by midzonal or periportal hepatocytes. In HCC, strong and diffuse GS expression in seen in tumor cells. Results: Glypican3 immunopositvity was highly specific and sensitive indicator for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as glutamine synthetase which was found to be a sensitive and specific indicator for development of hepatocellular carcinoma when compared to cirrhosis, liver cell dyspalsia and metastatic carcinomas. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between GPC3 and GS with tumor size (P=0.003, p=0.006, respectively). Diffuse staining significantly associated with large tumor size while, focal and mixed staining was detected more with small tumor size. Studying the relation with tumor grade also revealed significant association between diffuse GPC3 and GS staining with high tumor grade. Diffuse staining was detected in 91.7% and 100% respectively of poorly differentiated specimens and only in 33.3% and 22.2% of well differentiated specimens. Conclusions: While using GPC3 and GS to screen for premalignant hepatic lesions remains controversial, our data suggest that GPC3 and GS may be a reliable diagnostic immunomarkers to distinguish HCC from benign hepatocellular lesions. However, negative immunostaining should not exclude the diagnosis of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "In 1984, a 24-year-old woman underwent a right hepatectomy after a 17-cm nodule, diagnosed as a hepatocellular adenoma with some atypia. The resection was incomplete. Follow-up was interrupted. In 1996, a computed tomographic scan revealed a large multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed on biopsies. The patient died the same year. We reviewed these nodules using immunohistochemistry and gene sequencing. C-reactive protein was overexpressed in the tumor resected in 1984. Glutamine synthetase was heterogeneous in the tumor, with a few tumor nuclei expressing β-catenin. Glypican and heat shock protein 70 were negative. In this β-catenin-activated inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma, S45 β-catenin-activating mutation was detected on fixed tissue, embedded in paraffin without TERT promoter mutation. An identical CTNNB1 mutation was identified in the 1996 liver tumor together with a TERT promoter mutation showing that this hepatocellular carcinoma results from the malignant transformation of the initial β-catenin inflammatory adenoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: A broad range of hepatocellular nodules has been reported in hepatic vascular disorders. It is not clear whether hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) in this context share the same characteristics as conventional HCA. The aim of this study was to carry out a retrospective multicenter survey of hepatocellular nodules associated with hepatic vascular disorders. Methods: Forty-five cases were reviewed, including 32 Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Benign nodules were subtyped using the HCA immunohistochemical panel. Results: Nodules with a HCA morphology were observed in 11 cases. Six originated in BCS: two were liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) negative (one with malignant transformation); two expressed glutamine synthetase (GS) and nuclear b-catenin, two expressed C reactive protein (CRP). Among three cases with portal vein agenesis, one nodule was LFABP negative, two expressed GS and nuclear b-catenin, both with malignant transformation. In a Fallot tetralogy case, there were multiple LFABP negative nodules with borderline features and in a hepatoportal sclerosis case, the nodule looked like an inflammatory HCA. Two additional cases had nodules expressing CRP, without typical characteristics of inflammatory HCA. Conclusion: HCA of different immunohistochemical phenotype can develop in hepatic vascular disorders; they may have a different behavior compared to conventional HCA and be more at risk of malignant transformation.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: β-Catenin-activated hepatocellular adenomas have an elevated risk of harboring foci of hepatocellular carcinoma. Inflammatory adenomas also have an increased propensity for malignant transformation and are associated with a systemic inflammatory syndrome. Patients with these two adenoma subtypes benefit from excision. We assessed whether β-catenin-activated and inflammatory adenomas could be identified using a limited immunohistochemical panel. Methods: Forty-six adenomas were assessed by morphology and β-catenin, serum amyloid A, and glutamine synthetase immunostains. Results: Morphologic examination produced a morphologic working diagnosis of inflammatory adenoma in 25 (54%) of 46 cases, β-catenin-activated adenoma in three (7%) of 46 cases, and 18 (39%) of 46 cases of other adenomas. After immunohistochemical staining, the morphologic diagnosis was confirmed in 15 (33%) of 46 and changed in 20 (43%) of 46, for a final distribution of 16 (35%) of 46 inflammatory adenomas, four (9%) of 46 β-catenin-activated adenomas, seven (15%) of 46 β-catenin-activated inflammatory adenomas, and 19 (41%) of 46 other adenomas. Conclusions: Inflammatory and β-catenin-activated adenomas were readily identified by immunostaining patterns. These findings reinforce the necessity of immunohistochemistry in classifying adenomas, as assessing morphology alone often provided inaccurate subclassification. β-Catenin-activated and inflammatory adenomas can be accurately diagnosed using only a limited panel of widely available immunostains.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The pathologic distinction between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is sometimes problematic due to histologic overlap between the 2 entities, a problem amplified on small biopsy specimens. Several recently characterized immunohistochemical markers such as glypican-3 (GPC-3), heat-shock protein-70 (HSP-70), and glutamine synthetase (GS) help distinguish dysplastic nodules from HCC. The utility of this panel in the distinction of low-grade hepatocellular carcinoma (LG-HCC) from HCA has not been fully described. Objective: To determine whether the above markers are useful in the distinction of HCCs from HCAs. Design: Tissue microarrays were constructed with 30 LG-HCCs and 18 HCAs. The arrays were stained with the above markers and analyzed with respect to amount and pattern of staining. GPC-3 and HSP-70 were considered positive when 10% of tumor cells showed immunoreactivity. GS was considered positive when 50% of tumor cells showed immunoreactivity. Results: GPC-3 was positive in 13 of 30 LG-HCCs and 0 of 18 adenomas. The sensitivity was 43% and the specificity was 100%. HSP-70 was positive in 14 of 30 LG-HCCs and 0 of 18 adenomas. The sensitivity was 46% and the specificity was 100%. GS was positive in 24 of 30 LG-HCCs and 9 of 18 adenomas. The sensitivity was 80% and the specificity was 50%. Conclusions: GPC-3 and HSP-70 are helpful in separating carcinomas from adenomas. GS is not useful in this clinical context.",

    "Abstract": "Expression profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma has demonstrated that glypican 3 (GPC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan anchored to the membrane, is expressed at a markedly elevated level in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this paper, two monoclonal antibodies against GPC3, GPC3-C02 and A1836A, were confirmed to specifically recognize GPC3 molecule in cells from hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastoma cell lines by immunoblotting, and both were confirmed to recognize different epitopes of the GPC3 molecule by epitope mapping. Then, we evaluated the feasibility of GPC3-immunohistochemistry in the pathological diagnosis of benign and malignant hepatocellular lesions by applying these monoclonal antibodies to formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens. The immunoreactivity turned out to be identical in the two monoclonal antibodies and was thus confirmed to represent the actual expression of the GPC3 molecule. The expression was observed in the fetal liver, but not in normal adult liver, liver cirrhosis or hepatitis except for a tiny focus of a regenerative nodule of fulminant hepatitis. Diffusely positive staining of GPC3 was observed in malignant hepatocytes in hepatoblastomas and in hepatocellular carcinomas (47/56, 84%). GPC3 expression was independent of the differentiation and size of the hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, there was only weak and focal staining in low-grade (2/8) and high-grade dysplastic nodules (6/8). GPC3 immunoreactivity was detected in only one of 23 metastatic lesions of colorectal carcinoma, and its expression was entirely absent in the liver cell adenoma (0/7), carcinoid tumor (0/1), and cholangiocellular carcinoma (0/16). When compared with immunohistochemistry of hepatocyte antigen and alpha-fetoprotein, GPC3-immunohistochemistry was significantly much more specific and sensitive for hepatocellular carcinomas. Thus, GPC3 was confirmed to be one of the oncofetal proteins now attracting attention for their promise both as markers of hepatocellular carcinoma in routine histological examination and as targets in monoclonal antibody-based hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.",

    "Abstract": "The current clinical practice is based on the assumption of strong correlation between diffuse glutamine synthetase expression and β-catenin activation in hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. This high correlation is based on limited data and may represent an oversimplification as glutamine synthetase staining patterns show wide variability in clinical practice. Standardized criteria for interpreting diverse glutamine synthetase patterns, and the association between each pattern and β-catenin mutations is not clearly established. This study examines the correlation between glutamine synthetase staining patterns and β-catenin mutations in 15 typical hepatocellular adenomas, 5 atypical hepatocellular neoplasms and 60 hepatocellular carcinomas. Glutamine synthetase staining was classified into one of the three patterns: (a) diffuse homogeneous: moderate-to-strong cytoplasmic staining in >90% of lesional cells, without a map-like pattern, (b) diffuse heterogeneous: moderate-to-strong staining in 50-90% of lesional cells, without a map-like pattern, and (c) patchy: moderate-to-strong staining in <50% of lesional cells (often perivascular), or weak staining irrespective of the extent, and all other staining patterns (including negative cases). Sanger sequencing of CTNNB1 exon 3 was performed in all cases. Of hepatocellular tumors with diffuse glutamine synthetase staining (homogeneous or heterogeneous), an exon 3 β-catenin mutation was detected in 33% (2/6) of typical hepatocellular adenoma, 75% (3/4) of atypical hepatocellular neoplasm and 17% (8/47) of hepatocellular carcinomas. An exon 3 mutation was also observed in 15% (2/13) of hepatocellular carcinomas with patchy glutamine synthetase staining. The results show a modest correlation between diffuse glutamine synthetase immunostaining and exon 3 β-catenin mutations in hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma with discrepancy rates >50% in both hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. The interpretation of β-catenin activation based on glutamine synthetase staining should be performed with caution, and the undetermined significance of various glutamine synthetase patterns should be highlighted in pathology reports.",

    "Abstract": "An 18-year-old man underwent liver transplantation due to an Abernethy malformation associated with multiple hepatocellular nodules including one which was rapidly enlarging and was suspicious for malignant transformation. Analysis of the explanted liver showed a spectrum of multiple hepatocellular nodules ranging in appearance from focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma and to a well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasm borderline for hepatocellular carcinoma. Mutational analysis revealed wild-type β-catenin expression in the background liver and some nodules, whilst different variants were present in other lesions irrespective of their morphological appearance. No telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation was identified. Abernethy malformations can lead to independent genetic events which can result in β-catenin mutations associated with malignant transformation of hepatocellular nodules. When following up such patients, one must therefore have a high index of suspicion, particularly if radiological surveillance reveals a change in the nature of hepatic lesions.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatoblastoma is the most frequent malignant hepatic tumor in children. Expression of high mobility group AT-hook 2, an architectural nuclear factor and marker for hepatic progenitor cells, has not been studied in detail in hepatocellular neoplasms. Immunohistochemical stains using antibodies against high mobility group AT-hook 2, β-catenin, glypican-3, p53, and Ki-67 were performed in 15 hepatoblastomas, 15 fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinomas, 34 hepatocellular carcinomas (12, ≤30 years old; 22, >30 years old), and 22 hepatic adenomas. High mobility group AT-hook 2 was expressed in all 15 hepatoblastomas, including all fetal and embryonal components, significantly higher than in 41.7% (5/12) of hepatocellular carcinomas of 30 years or younger (P = .001) and in 9% (2/22) of hepatocellular carcinomas of older than 30 years (P < .001). Aberrant β-catenin expression was detected in 80% (12/15) of hepatoblastomas, 41.6% (5/12) of hepatocellular carcinomas of 30 years or younger, and 18.2% (4/22) of hepatocellular carcinomas of older than 30 years. All 15 fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinomas and 22 hepatic adenomas were negative for high mobility group AT-hook 2 or β-catenin. High mobility group AT-hook 2 and β-catenin expression correlated positively (P = .017; τ = 0.522) in 34 hepatocellular carcinomas. β-Catenin and glypican-3 exhibited a distinct spatial distribution within hepatoblastomas; glypican-3 was more frequently expressed in fetal components (P = .007), whereas β-catenin tended to be more frequently expressed in embryonal components (P = .062). In conclusion, high mobility group AT-hook 2 is expressed in all hepatoblastomas and could be used as a sensitive marker in their diagnosis. High mobility group AT-hook 2 was also expressed in a subset of hepatocellular carcinomas in association with β-catenin expression; this might represent a subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatic progenitor cell differentiation.",

    "Abstract": "Well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasms are currently classified in the World Health Organization scheme as hepatocellular adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no recognized diagnostic category for atypical cases with borderline features, and we have designated these as atypical hepatocellular neoplasms. Diffuse glutamine synthetase staining is used as a surrogate marker to detect β-catenin activation, a well-recognized high risk feature in hepatocellular tumors. This study examined 27 well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasms with diffuse glutamine synthetase staining, including 7 atypical hepatocellular neoplasms with no cytoarchitectural atypia, 6 atypical hepatocellular neoplasms with focal cytoarchitectural atypia, and 14 well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas. Capture-based next-generation sequencing was performed, and alterations in WNT pathway genes (CTNNB1, APC, AXIN1) were seen in 81% of cases (10/13 atypical hepatocellular neoplasms and 12/14 of hepatocellular carcinomas), while the molecular basis of diffuse glutamine synthetase staining was unclear in the remaining 19% of cases. Additional non-WNT pathway mutations (TP53, TSC1, DNMT3A, CREBBP) or copy number alterations were present in 56% of atypical hepatocellular neoplasms, with no significant difference in cases with or without focal cytoarchitectural atypia, supporting that all cases with β-catenin activation should be classified as atypical irrespective of atypia. Atypical hepatocellular neoplasm and hepatocellular carcinoma also demonstrated largely similar genomic profiles, but TERT promoter mutations were restricted to hepatocellular carcinoma (21%) and copy number alterations were more common in hepatocellular carcinoma (64 vs 31%). Mutational and copy number analysis may be helpful in characterization and risk stratification of atypical hepatocellular neoplasms when morphology and glutamine synthetase staining yield ambiguous results.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To investigate the significance of downregulation of liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Tissue microarrays of 146 cases of HCC were used to perform immunohistochemical staining for L-FABP. For each L-FABP-negative HCC, further immunohistochemical staining was performed using a representative whole-tissue section to confirm the downregulation of L-FABP expression and to assess the intratumoral heterogeneity of the staining pattern. Clinical data were retrieved from the clinical files, and histological slides were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK 19, β-catenin, glutamine synthetase (GS), and serum amyloid A were also performed on the tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological features of the L-FABP-negative and L-FABP-positive HCC cases were compared. Furthermore, L-FABP and GS gene expression in HCC and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were analyzed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mutation analysis of HNF1A [encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1)α] was performed for L-FABP-negative HCC cases. Results: Sixteen (10.9%) of the 146 cases of HCC stained negative for L-FABP. When we examined the correlation between the downregulation pattern of L-FABP and tumor size, most cases of smaller HCC (≤ 2 cm in diameter) exhibited focal downregulation, while most cases of larger HCC (> 2 cm in diameter) exhibited diffuse downregulation. The correlation was statistically significant (P = 0.036). When the HCC was smaller, the L-FABP-negative area often corresponded to a \"nodule-in-nodule\" appearance. Among the small HCC cases, tumor differentiation was significantly lower, and the frequency of intratumoral inflammation was significantly lower in L-FABP-negative cases than in L-FABP-positive cases (P = 0.032 and P = 0.009, respectively). The frequency of positivity for β-catenin and GS staining was significantly higher in L-FABP-negative cases of small HCC than in L-FABP-positive cases of small HCC (P = 0.009 and P = 0.000, respectively). Among six HCC cell lines examined, four showed higher expression of L-FABP, and the remaining two cell lines showed lower or no expression of L-FABP. Two of the 16 L-FABP-negative HCC cases possessed a mutation in exon 4 of HNF1A. Conclusion: In smaller HCC, L-FABP downregulation probably occurs because of phenotypic changes during tumor progression. Moreover, this downregulation correlated with tumor differentiation and intratumoral inflammation.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the two most common primary malignant liver tumours in children. Hepatic progenitor cells have been described and can be stained with K19, EpCAM and CD117. We investigated the morphology and staining patterns of primary liver tumours in Asian children. Methods: Four pathologists studied slides from 39 paediatric patients from Vietnam and Korea aged 8 months to 16 years. We performed immunohistochemical stains for K19, EpCAM and CD117, and polymerase chain reaction for tissue hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. Results: There was agreement on the diagnosis of 24 cases of HCC and 10 cases of HB (one recurrent case). The diagnosis was split for six cases (HCC/HB). All 20 cases of HCC tested were HBV DNA+ and HCV RNA-. All nine cases of HB tested were HBV DNA-, while one was HCV RNA+. Of four HCC/HB cases tested, three were HBV DNA+ and all were HCV RNA-. By immunohistochemistry, 8/24 (33%) cases of HCC were K19+ and 18/24 (75%) were EpCAM+, 5/10 (50%) cases of HB were K19+ and 7/10 (70%) were EpCAM+ and 3/6 (50%) cases of HCC/HB were K19+ and 5/6 (83%) were EpCAM+. CD117 was negative in all 38 cases tested. Paediatric HCC has a morphology different from adult HCC, sometimes resembling HB, and a larger proportion of paediatric tumours have progenitor cell features. Conclusions: HB and HCC in children may represent malignant transformation at an early stage in the cellular lineage and often arise from hepatic progenitor cells.",

Diffuse glutamine synthetase immunohistochemical positivity has been shown to be a reliable surrogate marker for β-catenin activation, though variations in staining patterns may be difficult to interpret. We report a case of a peliotic adenoma that was morphologically consistent with a β-catenin wild-type hepatocellular adenoma but harbored a β-catenin mutation by molecular analysis. The tumor lacked nuclear β-catenin positivity and demonstrated a hitherto undescribed pattern of glutamine synthetase overexpression restricted to areas of peliosis with mostly negative staining in non-peliotic areas. This pattern was initially interpreted as physiologic and may represent a potential pitfall in glutamine synthetase interpretation.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: A molecular and pathological classification system for hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) was recently introduced and four major subgroups were identified. We aimed to validate this adenoma classification system and to determine the clinical relevance of the subtypes for surgical management. Methods: Paraffin fixed liver tissue slides and resection specimens of patients radiologically diagnosed as HCA were retrieved from the department of pathology. Immunostainings included liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), glutamine synthetase (GS) and β-catenin. Results: From 2000 to 2010, 58 cases (71 lesions) were surgically resected. Fourteen lesions were diagnosed as focal nodular hyperplasia with a characteristic map-like staining pattern of GS. Inflammatory HCA expressing CRP and SAA was documented in 36 of 57 adenomas (63%). Three of these inflammatory adenomas were also β-catenin positive as well as GS positive and only one was CRP and SAA and GS positive. We identified eleven L-FABP-negative HCA (19%) and four β-catenin positive HCA (7%), without expression of CRP and SAA and with normal L-FABP staining, one of which was also GS positive. Six HCA were unclassifiable (11%). In three patients multiple adenomas of different subtypes were found. Conclusions: Morphology and additional immunohistochemical markers can discriminate between different types of HCA in>90% of cases and this classification, including the identification of β-catenin positive adenomas may have important implications in the decision for surveillance or treatment. Interpretation of nuclear staining for β-catenin can be difficult due to uneven staining distribution or focal nuclear staining and additional molecular biology may be required.",

In addition, we studied GPC3 expression in 225 cases of nonhepatic human tumors with epithelial differentiation. Ninety-four of 107 cases (88%) of HCC showed focal or diffuse cytoplasmic GPC3 staining, whereas all HA and FNH cases were GPC3-negative, and only 7 of 225 cases (3%) of nonhepatic tumors with epithelial differentiation expressed GPC3. The sensitivity and specificity of GPC3 for HCC was 88% and 97%, respectively. There were three CD34 staining patterns observed in hepatic tissue: negative, incomplete positive, and complete positive. In negative staining pattern, only blood vessels in portal triads or rare sinusoidal spaces immediately adjacent to portal tracts were positive. The negative staining pattern was seen in normal or cirrhotic liver tissue only. The complete CD34 staining pattern showed virtually all sinusoidal spaces with CD34-positive staining throughout the lesion. The complete CD34 staining pattern was seen in virtually all cases of HCC and in only some cases of HA and FNH. The incomplete CD34 staining pattern was characterized by either CD34 positivity in virtually all sinusoidal spaces in some but not all nodules or CD34 positivity in the peripheral sinusoidal spaces adjacent to portal triads. The incomplete CD34 staining pattern was seen in rare cases of HCC and in most cases of HA and FNH. We conclude that GPC3 is a very specific marker not only for differentiating HCC from nonhepatic tumors with epithelial differentiation, but also for differentiating HCC from HA and FNH. GPC3 immunoreactivity, in combination with a complete CD34 immunostaining pattern, greatly facilitates the accuracy of distinguishing between malignant hepatic lesions and benign mimickers.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Glutamine synthetase (GS), heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70), and glypican-3 (GPC-3) are markers best characterized in hepatocellular lesions, where they are useful in distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma from dysplastic nodules. Their staining patterns in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH-ChCa) and metastatic tumors in liver are not well described. Methods: Tissue microarrays containing 41 IH-ChCa and 24 metastatic tumors in liver were stained with commercially available antibodies to GS, HSP-70, and GPC-3. Five percent staining of tumor cells was considered positive for HSP-70 and GPC-3. For GS, 50% was the cut-off. Results: GS reactivity was present in 31 of 41 IH-ChCa (76%), with the median amount of staining being 65% of tumor cells. HSP-70 reactivity was present in 36 of 41 IH-ChCa (88%) with the median amount of staining being 75% of tumor cells. GPC-3 reactivity was absent from all IH-ChCa. Twenty-seven of 41 IH-ChCa cases were positive for both GS and HSP-70 (66%). GS reactivity was present in 17 of 24 tumors metastatic to liver (71%), with the median amount of staining being 50% of tumor cells. HSP-70 reactivity was present in 21 of 24 tumors metastatic to liver (88%) with the median amount of staining being 80% of tumor cells. GPC-3 reactivity was present in 2 of 24 tumors metastatic to liver (8%) with one showing 5% staining and the other showing 50% staining of tumor cells. Fifteen of 24 cases were positive for both GS and HSP-70 (63%), and 2 cases were positive for all 3 markers (8%). Discussion: Of the panel of immunostains currently commonly used to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from dysplastic hepatocytic nodules, only GPC-3 did not react frequently with metastatic tumors and IH-ChCa, although there was staining in 2 metastatic tumors. GS and HSP-70 are typically positive in IH-ChCa and metastatic tumors. Nothing should be inferred about the histogenesis of a tumor based on positive staining with either of these 2 markers, which currently have no role in tumor of unknown origin panels.",

    "Abstract": "Various immunohistochemical panels are used as aids to distinguish between primary hepatocellular malignancies and metastatic tumors and between benign lesions and carcinomas. We compared the immunohistochemical spectrum of hepatocellular lesions in mice with that of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Specifically, we compared the staining parameters of 128 murine foci of cellular alteration (FCA) and tumors (adenoma and HCC) from archival tissue blocks of 3 transgenic mouse models (LFABP-cyclin D1, Alb1-TGFβ1, and LFABP-cyclin D1 × Alb1-TGFβ1) with those of archival human HCC (n = 5). Antibodies were chosen according to their published performance and characterization in human hepatocellular tumor diagnosis and included: arginase 1 (Arg1), β-catenin, glutamine synthetase (GS), glypican 3, hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1), and cytokeratin 19 (CK19). GS was the single best immunostain for identifying hepatocellular tumors in mice, with 100% positive staining. Data showed a trend toward loss of normal function (staining) with Arg1, with a higher percentage of positive staining in FCA than in adenomas and HCC. All FCA lacked murine β-catenin nuclear translocation, which was present in 2 of the 7 adenomas and 22 of the 96 HCC tested. HepPar1 staining was lower than anticipated, except in trabecular HCC (16 of 22 samples were positive). Glyp3 stained very lightly, and only scattered CK19-positive cells were noted (4 of 44 cases of mouse trabecular HCC). Thus, GS appears to be the most useful marker for identifying neoplasia in the transgenic mouse models we tested and should be included in immunohistochemistry assessing hepatocellular neoplasia development.",

    "Abstract": "A mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumor of the liver arising in an adult is rare and is mostly classified as sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, a case of sarcomatoid HCC in an adult with hepatoblastoma (HB)-like features, which produced difficulty in the differential diagnosis between sarcomatoid HCC and mixed HB, is presented. The epithelial component of the tumor composed of poorly differentiated HCC, Edmondson's grade III, and more primitive components, which were embryonal and small cell undifferentiated components of HB-like areas. The small undifferentiated cells surrounded HCC and the embryonal component of HB-like area, and revealed transition partly to areas of rhabdomyosarcoma. A small portion of chondrosarcoma was also noted. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that HCC and the embryonal component of HB-like areas expressed alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and cytokeratin 8. The small undifferentiated cells were negative for AFP but stained with cytokeratin 8 as well as CD56, which is a marker of primitive cells in many sarcoma and HB. It is not certain whether small undifferentiated cells belong to hepatic progenitor cells or primitive mesenchymal cells. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis for beta-catenin mutation using microdissection revealed no mutation of any components. A review was undertaken of the cases previously reported as adult hepatoblastoma without detailed immunohistochemical study and consider many of them may be sarcomatoid HCC. These primitive and sarcomatoid components would be arising from the dedifferentiation process of HCC.",

However, there are very few reports of associations with pediatric hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) and no reported associations with pigmented HCAs (P-HCAs).

The gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical features are described for each tumor. In addition, the literature is reviewed with specific emphasis on the clinical and pathologic features of B-HCAs. Although the potential of β-catenin-activated HCAs to progress to hepatocellular carcinoma has been well documented, there are very few reports of their potential to progress to hepatoblastoma. We not only present such a case, but, to our knowledge, we also present the first case of a P-HCA in a child.",

    "Abstract": "Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver can show morphological features similar to hepatocellular adenoma. In rare instances, hepatocellular carcinoma can arise in the setting of hepatocellular adenoma. This study compares the immunohistochemical and cytogenetic features of the hepatocellular adenoma-like and hepatocellular carcinoma portions of these tumors. Immunohistochemistry for β-catenin, glutamine synthetase, serum amyloid A protein, glypican-3, and heat-shock protein 70 was done in 11 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma arising in hepatocellular adenoma in non-cirrhotic liver. Tumors with nuclear β-catenin and/or diffuse glutamine synthetase were considered β-catenin activated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was done in nine cases for gains of chromosomes 1, 8 and MYC. There were seven men (33-75 years) and four women (29-65 years). Focal atypical morphological features were seen in hepatocellular adenoma-like areas in 7 (64%) cases. Hepatocellular adenoma-like areas showed features of inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma in 7 (64%) cases; 4 of these were also serum amyloid A-positive in the hepatocellular carcinoma portion. β-Catenin activation, heat-shock protein 70 positivity, and chromosomal gains on FISH were seen in the hepatocellular adenoma portion in 55%, 40%, and 56% of cases, and 73%, 60%, and 78% of cases in the hepatocellular carcinoma portion, respectively. In conclusion, the hepatocellular adenoma-like portion of most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma arising in hepatocellular adenoma shows features typically seen in hepatocellular carcinoma such as focal morphological abnormalities, β-catenin activation, heat-shock protein 70 expression, and chromosomal gains. Hepatocellular adenoma-like areas in these tumors, especially in men and older women, may represent an extremely well-differentiated variant of hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas the morphologically recognizable hepatocellular carcinoma portion represents a relatively higher grade component of the tumor.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To study the expression and significance of GPC3, CD10 and CD34 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), dysplastic nodules (DN), cirrhotic regenerative nodules (CRN), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and hepatocellular adenoma (HA). Methods: Immunohistochemical study for GPC3, CD10, CD34 and AFP was performed on 80 cases of HCC (30 cases of well-differentiated HCC and 50 cases of advanced HCC), 30 cases of DN (18 cases of high-grade DN and 12 cases of low-grade DN), 36 cases of CRN, 20 cases of FNH and 20 cases of HA. Results: (1) The positive expression rate of GPC3 was 92% (46/50) in advanced HCC, 66.7% (20/30) in well-differentiated HCC, 2/18 in high-grade DN, and 0 in low-grade DN, CRN, FNH and HA. The expression rate of GPC3 in well-differentiated HCC was lower than that in advanced HCC and higher than that in high-grade DN (P < 0.05). (2) The negative expression rate of CD10 was 78% (39/50) in advanced HCC, 43.3% (13/30) in well-differentiated HCC, 20% (4/20 and 4/20) in both FNH and HA, 2.8% (1/36) in CRN and 0 in both high-grade DN and low-grade DN. The occurrence of CD10-strongly positive cells was 2% (1/50) in advanced HCC, 16.7% (5/30) in well-differentiated HCC, 15/18 in high-grade DN, 11/12 in low-grade DN, 80.6% (29/36) in CRN and 60% (12/20 and 12/20) in both FNH and HA. The positive expression rate of CD10 in well-differentiated HCC was higher than that in advanced HCC and lower than that in high-grade DN, low-grade DN, CRN, FNH and HA (P < 0.05). (3) The positive expression rates of CD34 in advanced HCC and well-differentiated HCC ranged from 25% to 100% [and strongly positive in 76% (38/50) and 70% (21/30), respectively]. The rates in high-grade DN and low-grade DN ranged from 5% to 25% (and weakly positive in 16/18 and 10/12, respectively). In CRN, the rate ranged from 0 to 5% [and weakly positive in 27.8% (10/36)]. In FNH and HA, the positive rates ranged from 25% to 50%. The positive expression rate of CD34 in well-differentiated HCC was significantly higher than that in high-grade DN, low-grade DN, CRN, FNH and HA (P < 0.05). (4) The positive expression rate of AFP was 44% (22/50) in advanced HCC, 20% (6/30) in well-differentiated HCC, no expression in DN, LCN, LCN, FNH and HA. The positive expression rate of AFP in well-differentiated HCC was lower than that in advanced HCC and higher than that in LCN, FNH and HA. The different expression had statistical significance (P < 0.05). Conclusions: GPC3 is a relatively sensitive and specific marker in pathologic diagnosis of HCC. When coupled with immunohistochemical results of CD34, CD10 and AFP, GPC3 is useful in differentiating HCC from DN, LCN, FNH and HA.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a useful marker in tumour liver pathology, including hepatocellular adenomas and nodules in cirrhosis. We investigated the use of GS as a marker in various clinical situations, in which FNH diagnosis had been firmly established to determine its contribution to diagnosis. Methods: Seventy-nine cases of resected FNH, all on normal (or occasionally steatotic) livers, were retrieved from our collection. The control group was composed of hepatocellular adenomas and well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The following stains: H&E, Masson's trichrome, Gordon-Sweet, PAS, perls and immunostains: CK7 and 19, and GS were carried out. FNH was diagnosed based on traditional pathological techniques. In case of uncertainty, particularly with hepatocellular adenoma, additional immunostainings including liver fatty acid-binding protein, serum amyloid A and beta-catenin were performed. Results: Glutamine synthetase immunostaining was similar in all FNH cases. Positive GS staining of hepatocytic cytoplasms formed large areas, anastomosed in a 'map-like' pattern, often surrounding hepatic veins, whereas GS was not expressed in hepatocytes close to fibrotic bands containing arteries and ductules. In comparison, hepatocellular adenoma staining was completely different, even in cases of fibrotic bands due to tumour remodelling related to necrosis or haemorrhage. In hepatocellular adenomas or well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma presenting beta-catenin mutation, GS was positive but with a completely different pattern that appeared diffuse and not 'map-like'. Conclusion: Regardless of the FNH size or steatotic content, GS produced a similar and characteristic pattern and consequently represents a good marker for easily identifying resected FNH from other hepatocellular nodules.",

    "Abstract": "Glypican-3 (GPC3) is an oncofetal protein that has been demonstrated to be a useful diagnostic immunomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastoma. Its expression in mesenchymal tumors of the liver, particularly undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (UES) and mesenchymal hamartoma (MH), has not been investigated. In this study, a total of 24 UESs and 18 MHs were immunohistochemically stained for GPC3 expression. The results showed cytoplasmic staining for GPC3 in 14 (58%) UESs, of which 6 exhibited diffuse immunoreactivity and the remaining 8 showed focal positivity. The patients with GPC3-positive UES tended to be younger (mean 18 years; median 11 years) than those with GPC3-negative tumors (mean 39.4 years; median 27 years), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .06). Eight MHs also exhibited GPC3 immunoreactivity (44%; 4 diffuse and 4 focal). Positive staining in all 8 cases was primarily seen in entrapped nonlesional hepatocytes with a canalicular and cytoplasmic staining pattern. In only 4 cases (22%) was GPC3 immunoreactivity also observed in the mesenchymal component. The patients with positive staining also tended to be younger (mean 2.6 years; median 1.1 years) compared with those with negative staining (mean 16.3 years; median 4.5 years), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .15). Our data demonstrate that GPC3 is expressed in a subset of UES and MH of the liver. Caution should thus be exercised when evaluating a GPC3-expressing hepatic neoplasm, particularly on a needle biopsy when the differential diagnosis includes poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma.",

Methods and results: One hundred liver nodules, i.e. 66 HCCs and 34 non-neoplastic nodules, were prospectively collected from 43 consecutive orthotopic liver transplantation patients, and subjected to 'backtable' needle biopsies directly on surgical specimens. IHC evaluation was semi-automatically performed with a Benchmark Ultra immunostainer. The morphological and IHC diagnosis in surgical specimens was considered to be the gold standard. GS, GPC3, HSP70 and EZH2 showed 16.6%, 10.7%, 28.8% and 62.1% decreases in sensitivity, respectively, from surgical specimen to needle biopsy. Higher decreases were observed in <10-mm nodules. In 18 HCCs with no morphological diagnostic features of malignancy in biopsies, GPC3 or GS were positive in 16; in seven HCCs, neither morphology nor IHC evaluation ruled out the differential diagnosis made on the basis of needle biopsy. Conclusions: We present for the first time a direct comparison between surgical specimens and needle biopsies to confirm the usefulness and reproducibility of the most widely used antibodies for the diagnosis of small liver nodules. Our results support the use of IHC evaluation in biopsies for the diagnosis of small liver lesions, although the IHC panel could also give negative results in the presence of obvious HCC, and the possibility of false positives should always be considered.",

This study evaluates the efficacy of combined use of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), glutamine synthetase (GS) and glypican-3 in this setting. Immunohistochemistry for these three markers was done in 17 typical hepatocellular adenoma, 15 high-grade dysplastic nodules, 20 atypical hepatocellular neoplasms (14 clinically atypical and 6 pathologically atypical), 14 very well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and 43 well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.

Glypican-3 was negative in all atypical neoplasms and very well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and was positive in 27% of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Positive staining with at least one marker (HSP70 and/or GS) was seen in 85% of very well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, which was similar to well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (78%, P=0.4), and pathologically atypical cases (100%, P=0.5), but significantly higher compared with clinically atypical cases (43%. P=0.03) and none of typical adenomas (P<0.001). Positive staining with both GS and HSP70 was seen significantly more often in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with atypical neoplasms (45 vs 10%, P=0.004). Both these markers were also more often expressed in very well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma compared with atypical cases (38 vs 10%, P=0.06). In conclusion, the combined use of GS and HSP70 can be useful in the diagnosis of very well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. These stains can also help in the distinction of typical adenoma from atypical hepatocellular neoplasms. Glypican-3 has low sensitivity and is not useful in this setting.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Glutamine plays an important role in cell viability and growth of various tumors. For the fetal subtype of hepatoblastoma, growth inhibition through glutamine depletion was shown. We studied glutamine depletion in embryonal cell lines of hepatoblastoma carrying different mutations. Since asparagine synthetase was identified as a prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in adult hepatocellular carcinoma, we investigated the expression of its gene ASNS and of the gene GLUL, encoding for glutamine synthetase, in hepatoblastoma specimens and cell lines and investigated the correlation with overall survival. Methods: We correlated GLUL and ASNS expression with overall survival using publicly available microarray and clinical data. We examined GLUL and ASNS expression by RT-qPCR and by Western blot analysis in the embryonal cell lines Huh-6 and HepT1, and in five hepatoblastoma specimens. In the same cell lines, we investigated the effects of glutamine depletion. Hepatoblastoma biopsies were examined for histology and CTNNB1 mutations. Results: High GLUL expression was associated with a higher median survival time. Independent of mutations and histology, hepatoblastoma samples showed strong GLUL expression and glutamine synthesis. Glutamine depletion resulted in the inhibition of proliferation and of cell viability in both embryonal hepatoblastoma cell lines. ASNS expression did not correlate with overall survival. Conclusion: Growth inhibition resulting from glutamine depletion, as described for the hepatoblastoma fetal subtype, is also detected in established embryonal hepatoblastoma cell lines carrying different mutations. At variance with adult hepatocellular carcinoma, in hepatoblastoma asparagine synthetase has no prognostic significance.",

    "Abstract": "Context: The correct histologic diagnosis of mass lesions of the liver can be difficult, especially in biopsy samples. Reticulin, glypican-3, and glutamine synthetae are stains that can help distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma, and focal nodular hyperplasia. Objective: To evaluate the utility of a triple stain of reticulin, glypican-3, and glutamine synthetae in distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma, and focal nodular hyperplasia. Design: Whole tissue sections and tissue microarrays were evaluated with a triple stain of reticulin, followed by glutamine synthetae (diaminobenzidine, brown chromogen) and glypican-3 (alkaline phosphatase, red chromogen). The 109 cases evaluated included whole tissue section hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 16), tissue microarray hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 19), whole tissue section hepatic adenoma (n = 15), tissue microarray hepatic adenoma (n = 13), whole tissue section focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 13; 12%), tissue microarray focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 13), as well as nonmalignant liver parenchyma adjacent to hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 20). All cases were scored for reticulin being intact or lost, positive or negative staining for glypican-3, and diffuse, maplike, perivenular, or negative staining for glutamine synthetae. Results: The combination of intact reticulin with either glypican-3 negativity or negative glutamine synthetae was 92% sensitive and 95% specific in the distinction of tissue microarray hepatic adenoma from hepatocellular carcinoma. For the distinction of tissue microarray focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic adenoma, maplike glutamine synthetae was most useful and was 85% sensitive and 100% specific. Conclusions: The triple stain of reticulin, glypican-3, and glutamine synthetae is useful in the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma, and focal nodular hyperplasia on biopsy specimens. Furthermore, this triple stain is advantageous to single stains and can help when aberrant staining patterns are observed.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: Nodule-in-nodule (N/N) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a convincing proof of multistep hepatocarcinogenesis. In this lesion, an inner HCC develops within an outer, more differentiated, tumour, which can be rapidly taken over by the former so that N/N HCC is rarely detected. Methods and results: Ten resected N/N HCCs arising in cirrhotic background and characterized: (i) as outer lesions by early (n = 3) and G1 (n = 7) HCC; (ii) as inner lesions by G1 (n = 3) and G2 (n = 7) HCC. The largest/smallest diameters of outer and inner nodules were, respectively, 20/6 mm and 16/4 mm. We investigated vascular (CD34 and endocan), hepatocellular VEGF, GS, GPC3, HSP70 and CHC) and molecular (TERT promoter and β-catenin) changes taking place from the outer neoplastic compartment to the inner neoplastic compartment (INC). A diffuse pattern of CD34+ capillarized vessels and focal endocan immunoreactivity were major distinctive features acquired in the INC; VEGF immunoreactivity was inversely related to CD34 staining. A gain in the number of cells immunoreactive for GPC3, HSP70, and CHC, but not of GS-immunoreactive cells, also occurred in the INC. TERT promoter mutations were seen in half of the cases in both compartments, whereas β-catenin mutations were more rarely detectable. Conclusions: Major phenotypic changes take place in the INC of N/N HCC. TERT promoter mutations take place frequently and very early, and, in contrast to β-catenin mutations, do not appear to be acquired during N/N growth. These findings suggest that inner nodules represent a step further along the pathway of tumour progression, in contrast to earlier, simply initiated, lesions, and that complete neovascularisation predicts a change in HCC biology.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common childhood liver cancer and occasionally presents with histological and clinical features reminiscent of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Identification of molecular mechanisms that drive the neoplastic continuation towards more aggressive HCC phenotypes may help to guide the new stage of targeted therapies. Methods: We performed comprehensive studies on genetic and chromosomal alterations as well as candidate gene function and their clinical relevance. Results: Whole-exome sequencing identified HB as a genetically very simple tumour (2.9 mutations per tumour) with recurrent mutations in ß-catenin (CTNNB1) (12/15 cases) and the transcription factor NFE2L2 (2/15 cases). Their HCC-like progenies share the common CTNNB1 mutation, but additionally exhibit a significantly increased mutation number and chromosomal instability due to deletions of the genome guardians RAD17 and TP53, accompanied by telomerase reverse-transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations. Targeted genotyping of 33 primary tumours and cell lines revealed CTNNB1, NFE2L2, and TERT mutations in 72.5%, 9.8%, and 5.9% of cases, respectively. All NFE2L2 mutations affected residues of the NFE2L2 protein that are recognized by the KEAP1/CUL3 complex for proteasomal degradation. Consequently, cells transfected with mutant NFE2L2 were insensitive to KEAP1-mediated downregulation of NFE2L2 signalling. Clinically, overexpression of the NFE2L2 target gene NQO1 in tumours was significantly associated with metastasis, vascular invasion, the adverse prognostic C2 gene signature, as well as poor outcome. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the importance of CTNNB1 mutations and NFE2L2-KEAP1 pathway activation in HB development and defines loss of genomic stability and TERT promoter mutations as prominent characteristics of aggressive HB with HCC features.",

    "Abstract": "There is considerable overlap in morphologic features in well-differentiated hepatocellular lesions necessitating the use of immunohistochemistry and other techniques for diagnosis. Map-like pattern with glutamine synthetase in focal nodular hyperplasia and cytoplasmic staining with serum amyloid associated protein in inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma (HA) are useful for this distinction. The distinction of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and HA in noncirrhotic liver is facilitated by demonstrating glypican-3 and cytogenetic changes like gains of chromosomes 1 and 8. Nuclear staining with β-catenin and/or diffuse staining with glutamine synthetase strongly favors well-differentiated HCC or HA with high risk for HCC. In a cirrhotic liver, separation of early HCC from high-grade dysplastic nodule requires identification of stromal invasion, which can be highlighted by absence of keratin 7-positive ductular reaction. Combined use of heat shock protein 70, glutamine synthetase, and glypican-3 can be useful as positivity for 2 or more of these markers has shown high specificity for HCC in early studies.",

    "Abstract": "Although activated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is considered to be one of the main driving forces of hepatocarcinogenesis, no somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene have been found in sporadic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to date. Here we present a case of a sporadic nodule-in-nodule-type HCC that provides the first evidence that biallelic genetic inactivation of the APC gene contributed to the development of the tumor. High-density array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed to clarify genome-wide chromosomal structural alteration profiles of both early and advanced components of this nodule-in-nodule HCC. aCGH analysis revealed a chromosomal loss of the APC gene locus only in the inner advanced component of this tumor. Direct sequencing of the remaining allele revealed a nonsense mutation at codon 682 in the Armadillo repeats, resulting in a truncated protein that lacked all of the beta-catenin-binding motifs. Nonsense mutations at this location are rare among other types of cancer. In conclusion, combined with an immunohistochemical analysis of the beta-catenin protein, this case provides the first evidence that genetic inactivation of the APC gene can play a significant role in the progression of sporadic HCC, probably by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically develops in cirrhotic livers. In the absence of risk factors, for example, cirrhosis or hepatitis B or C virus infection, HCC diagnosis might be difficult. We aimed to explore the value of immunohistochemical characteristics to diagnostics and prognosis, and whether these immunohistochemical characteristics differ from those of HCC in a cirrhotic liver, possibly indicating an aberrant pathogenetic pathway. Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue slides from liver resection specimens of the patients with HCC in a non-cirrhotic liver were analysed. From January 2000 through April 2011, 799 patients with HCC were admitted to our hospital; in total, 47 patients with 50 HCCs in a non-cirrhotic liver were operated. These tumours were stained positive for α-fetoprotein (AFP) in 30%, CD34 in 88%, cytokeratine 7 (CK7) in 44%, CK19 in 12%, glypican-3 (GPC-3) in 40%, glutamine synthetase in 62% and β-catenin in 32%. There was similarity in immunohistochemical expression of several markers comparing HCC in a non-cirrhotic liver with HCC in a cirrhotic liver. Moderate or poorly differentiated HCC more often expressed β-catenin and GPC-3 and showed a higher percentage of MIB-1-positive hepatocytes. A positive AFP immunohistochemical staining was significantly related with a high preoperative AFP serum level (p=0.001). None of the immunohistochemical stainings were associated with a worse overall survival. Of the patients treated with a surgical resection, 17 had recurrence of HCC and these patients more often had a positive CK19 staining (p=0.048). In conclusion, immunohistochemical expression of several markers in HCC in a non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic liver was comparable. Immunohistochemical markers have limited additional value to characterise HCC in non-cirrhoitc livers.",

    "Abstract": "Some hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) subtypes are characterized by different CTNNB1 mutations, leading to different beta-catenin activation levels, hence variable immunostaining patterns of glutamine synthetase (GS) expression, and different risks of malignant transformation. In a retrospective multicentric study of 63 resected inflammatory (n=33) and noninflammatory (n=30) molecularly confirmed CTNNB1-mutated b-(I)HCA, we investigated the predictive potential of 3 known GS patterns as markers for CTNNB1 exon 3, 7/8 mutations. Pattern 1 (diffuse homogenous) allowed recognition of 17/21 exon 3 non-S45 mutated b-(I)HCA. Pattern 2 (diffuse heterogenous) identified all b-(I)HCA harboring exon 3 S45 mutation (20/20). Pattern 3 (focal patchy) distinguished 12/22 b-(I)HCA with exon 7/8 mutations. In exon 3 S45 and 7/8 mutations, both b-HCA and b-IHCA showed a GS+/CD34- rim with diffuse CD34 positivity in the center of the lesion. Interobserver reproducibility was excellent for exon 3 mutations. Comparative analysis of GS patterns with molecular data showed 83% and 80% sensitivity (b-HCA/b-IHCA) and 100% specificity for exon 3 non-S45. For exon 3 S45, sensitivity was 100% for b-(I)HCA, and specificity 93% and 92% (b-HCA/b-IHCA). For exon 7/8, sensitivity was 55% for both subtypes and specificity 100% and 96% (b-HCA/b-IHCA). Preliminary data from 16 preoperative needle biopsies from the same patients suggest that this panel may also be applicable to small samples. In surgically resected HCA, 2 distinct GS patterns can reliably predict CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, which are relevant because of the higher risk for malignant transformation. The third pattern, although specific, was less sensitive for the identification of exon 7/8 mutation, but the GS+/CD34- rim is a valuable aid to indicate either an exon 3 S45 or exon 7/8 mutation.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: The primary aim of this study is to characterize hepatocellular malignant neoplasm, NOS (HEMNOS), a new provisional entity describing a subset of paediatric hepatocellular tumours, which have histological features of neither typical hepatoblastoma (HB) nor hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods and results: The clinicopathological features of 11 patients with HEMNOS were analysed retrospectively. The median age and serum alpha-fetoprotein level at diagnosis was 7 years and 182 000 ng/ml, respectively. Ten patients presented with pretreatment extent of disease (PRETEXT) stages III/IV multifocal tumours, eight with major vascular involvement, three with lung metastases and three with extrahepatic extension. The original pathology diagnoses were: HB in seven patients, HCC in two and HEMNOS in two. Our pathology review of pre-chemotherapy specimens showed that six tumours had equivocal/overlapping histological features of HB and HCC, four had predominant HB histology along with focal HCC-like histology and one had HB histology. Seven of nine post-chemotherapy resection specimens showed predominant HCC-like histology. Beta-catenin, glypican 3 and spalt-like transcription factor 4 immunostaining showed that all the tumours had a mixed HB/HCC immunophenotype. Telomerase reverse transcriptase immunostaining showed nuclear staining in nine of the 11 tumours. All patients received chemotherapy and achieved gross total primary tumour resection. Nine of the 11 patients were treated with established HB chemotherapy regimens. After a median follow-up of 6.1 years (range: 1.2-11.8 years), all patients were in remission. Conclusions: HEMNOS is a subtype of HB with focal HCC-like histology, a high-risk clinical profile but favourable outcome following chemotherapy and complete tumour resection.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric liver cancer. Histological evaluation of tumor biopsies is used to distinguish among the different subtypes of hepatoblastoma, with fetal and embryonal representing the two main epithelial components. With frequent CTNNB1 mutations, hepatoblastoma is a Wnt/β-catenin-driven malignancy. Considering that Wnt activation has been associated with tumor metabolic reprogramming, we characterized the metabolic profile of cells from hepatoblastoma and compared it to cells from hepatocellular carcinoma. First, we demonstrated that glucose transporter GLUT3 is a direct TCF4/β-catenin target gene. RNA sequencing enabled to identify molecular and metabolic features specific to hepatoblastoma and revealed that several glycolytic enzymes are overexpressed in embryonal-like compared to fetal-like tumor cells. This led us to implement successfully three biomarkers to distinguish embryonal from fetal components by immunohistochemistry from a large panel of human hepatoblastoma samples. Functional analyses demonstrated that embryonal-like hepatoblastoma cells are highly glycolytic and sensitive to hexokinase-1 silencing. Altogether, our findings reveal a new, metabolic classification of human hepatoblastoma, with potential future implications for patients' diagnosis and treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Fanconi-Bickel syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the facilitative glucose transporter 2 ( GLUT2 or SLC2A2) gene resulting in excessive glycogen storage predominantly in the liver and kidney. Previous case reports of this condition have described liver biopsies with glycogen storage and variable steatosis and/or fibrosis. Unlike in other types of glycogen storage disease, hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas have not been described to date in this syndrome. A 6-year-old boy with consanguineous parents had short stature, poorly controlled rickets, hepatosplenomegaly, and renal tubular dysfunction clinically consistent with Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome. Sequencing of the SLC2A2 gene showed a homozygous variant of unknown significance [c.474A > C (p.Arg158Ser)] causing a missense mutation in an evolutionarily conserved residue. An incidental single hepatic lesion was discovered on imaging, and subsequent resection showed a 2.6 cm well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with moderate atypia, diffuse immunoreactivity for glypican-3, and nuclear b-catenin, and with focal complete loss of the reticulin framework. The non-neoplastic liver showed marked glycogen accumulation with mild periportal fibrosis, rare bridging fibrosis, and no regenerative or adenomatous nodules. By electron microscopy, tumor cells had pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm with numerous mitochondria. Well-developed canaliculi were occasionally seen. The non-neoplastic liver showed glycogenosis with abundant cytoplasmic free (non-membrane bound) glycogen. Hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered as a possible complication of Fanconi-Bickel syndrome.

The nuclear beta-catenin immunoreactivity indicates a role for the Wnt signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of this tumor.",

    "Abstract": "Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at linear chromosome termini, protecting chromosomes against end-to-end fusion and damage, providing chromosomal stability. Telomeres shorten with mitotic cellular division, but are maintained in cells with high proliferative capacity by telomerase. Loss-of-function mutations in telomere-maintenance genes are genetic risk factors for cirrhosis development in humans and murine models. Telomerase deficiency provokes accelerated telomere shortening and dysfunction, facilitating genomic instability and oncogenesis. Here we examined whether telomerase mutations and telomere shortening were associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to cirrhosis. Telomere length of peripheral blood leukocytes was measured by Southern blot and qPCR in 120 patients with HCC associated with cirrhosis and 261 healthy subjects. HCC patients were screened for telomerase gene variants (in TERT and TERC) by Sanger sequencing. Age-adjusted telomere length was comparable between HCC patients and healthy subjects by both Southern blot and qPCR. Four non-synonymous TERT heterozygous variants were identified in four unrelated patients, resulting in a significantly higher mutation carrier frequency (3.3%) in patients as compared to controls (p = 0.02). Three of the four variants (T726M, A1062T, and V1090M) were previously observed in patients with other telomere diseases (severe aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and cirrhosis). A novel TERT variant, A243V, was identified in a 65-year-old male with advanced HCC and cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcohol ingestion, but direct assay measurements in vitro did not detect modulation of telomerase enzymatic activity or processivity. In summary, constitutional variants resulting in amino acid changes in the telomerase reverse transcriptase were found in a small proportion of patients with cirrhosis-associated HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Correlation between androgen use and hepatocellular neoplasia is well established. However, there are no detailed studies of the histopathology and immunohistochemical/molecular profile of these tumors. We studied 9 patients with androgen-associated hepatocellular neoplasms. In addition to histology, immunostains for liver fatty acid-binding protein, β-catenin, glutamine synthetase, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A were utilized for tumor subtyping. Molecular testing using Solid Tumor Targeted Cancer Panel was performed on 3 cases. The neoplasms were predominantly seen in male individuals (7/9). Two patients (22%) had multifocal lesions. All lesions had architectural and 4/9 had cytologic atypia. Cholestasis was present in 6/9 cases. Reticulin was focally disrupted in 5/9 cases. Given the clinical setting, all lesions were classified as well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasms of uncertain malignant potential. In cases with follow-up (6/9 cases, 67%), there were no recurrences or metastases. On the basis of the immunoprofile, 7 (78%) cases were β-catenin activated (including 1 hepatic adenoma with concurrent hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α inactivation) and 2 (22%) had inflammatory phenotype. Somatic mutations in CTNNB1 were detected in all 3 tested cases (all β-catenin activated by immunostain), all involving exon-3. Our data indicate that androgen-associated hepatocellular neoplasms most often develop in male individuals and always show some degree of atypia and/or focal reticulin disruption. Most are β-catenin activated, often harboring CTNNB1 exon-3 mutations, and a minority is inflammatory type. Although β-catenin and inflammatory pathways likely play a role in pathogenesis, the heterogenous molecular profile suggests there are other (yet to be characterized) primary oncogenic mechanisms in this unique tumor type.",

Clear cell carcinoma, a variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is another rare tumor of the liver that tends to affect adults. We describe the diagnosis and management of the only known documented case of a primary clear cell HCC arising twenty-five years after the patient was successfully treated with chemotherapy and surgical resection for a malignant HB as an infant. While some evidence has shown a genetic link between HB and various types of HCC, other research has shown distinct chromosomal alterations and molecular mechanisms unique to both. Further knowledge of liver tumorigenesis will help elucidate the complicated genetic, molecular, and environmental factors involved in the development of these two rare hepatic malignancies.",

    "Abstract": "Telomere repeats at chromosomal ends, critical to genome integrity, are maintained through an elaborate network of proteins and pathways. Shelterin complex proteins shield telomeres from induction of DNA damage response to overcome end protection problem. A specialized ribonucleic protein, telomerase, maintains telomere homeostasis through repeat addition to counter intrinsic shortcomings of DNA replication that leads to gradual sequence shortening in successive mitoses. The biogenesis and recruitment of telomerase composed of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) subunit and an RNA component, takes place through the intricate machinery that involves an elaborate number of molecules. The synthesis of telomeres remains a controlled and limited process. Inherited mutations in the molecules involved in the process directly or indirectly cause telomeropathies. Telomerase, while present in stem cells, is deactivated due to epigenetic silencing of the rate-limiting TERT upon differentiation in most of somatic cells with a few exceptions. However, in most of the cancer cells telomerase reactivation remains a ubiquitous process and constitutes one of the major hallmarks. Discovery of mutations within the core promoter of the TERT gene that create de novo binding sites for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors provided a mechanism for cancer-specific telomerase reactivation. The TERT promoter mutations occur mainly in tumors from tissues with low rates of self-renewal. In melanoma, glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma and others, the promoter mutations have been shown to define subsets of patients with adverse disease outcomes, associate with increased transcription of TERT, telomerase reactivation and affect telomere length; in stem cells the mutations inhibit TERT silencing following differentiation into adult cells. The TERT promoter mutations cause an epigenetic switch on the mutant allele along with recruitment of pol II following the binding of GABPA/B1 complex that leads to mono-allelic expression. Thus, the TERT promoter mutations hold potential as biomarkers as well as future therapeutic targets.",

    "Abstract": "Murine hepatoblastoma (HB) is a rare spontaneous tumor with controversial histogenesis. It mainly occurs in aged males, frequently in close association with preexisting hepatocellular neoplasms. The present work describes a spontaneous HB arising within a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a 22-month-old male C57BL/6J mouse. The mouse also developed pulmonary co-metastases with either tumor components physically associated within the same metastatic foci. Microscopically, the HB consisted of a densely cellular neoplastic growth composed of palisades and perivascular pseudorosettes of poorly differentiated primitive cells, with a scant amount of cytoplasm, elongated hyperchromatic nuclei, and a high mitotic rate, whereas the hepatocellular carcinoma was composed of solid areas of neoplastic hepatocytes. Both in primary tumors and their metastases, β-catenin immunohistochemistry revealed a strong nucleocytoplasmic signal in HB cells, while neoplastic hepatocytes displayed a delicate membranous staining pattern. These findings suggest that the Wnt/β-catenin oncogenic pathway is upregulated in murine HB but not in the co-existing HCC, thus providing some insights into their divergent pathogenesis. Coexisting murine HB and HCC have been demonstrated to be completely distinct entities including origin, mutational landscape, and molecular profile. In this context, they might be regarded as collision tumors because of their intimate association, unique histologic features, and distinct immunohistochemical patterns. Nevertheless, the nature of their coevolution and progression to a co-metastatic phenotype reflects a close interdependence and support the overall idea that HB's origin and progression might be promoted by not otherwise specified paracrine stimuli provided by the concurrent hepatocellular tumor (the so called \"interaction theory\").",

    "Abstract": "Following the classification of hepatocellular nodules by the International Working Party in 1995 and further elaboration by the International Consensus Group for Hepatocellular Neoplasia in 2009, entities under the spectrum of hepatocellular nodules have been better characterized. Research work hence has been done to answer questions such as distinguishing high-grade dysplastic nodules from early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), delineating the tumor cell origin of HCC, identifying its prognostic markers, and subtyping hepatocellular adenomas. As a result, a copious amount of data at immunohistochemical and molecular levels has emerged. A panel of immunohistochemical markers including glypican-3, heat shock protein 70 and glutamine synthetase has been found to be of use in the diagnosis of small, well differentiated hepatocellular tumors and particularly of HCC. The use of liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), β-catenin, glutamine synthetase, serum amyloid protein and C-reactive protein is found to be helpful in the subtyping of hepatocellular adenomas. The role of tissue biomarkers for prognostication in HCC and the use of biomarkers in subclassifying HCC based on tumor cell origin are also discussed.",

The β-catenin activated subtype accounts for 10-15% of all hepatocellular adenomas and specific magnetic resonance imaging features have been defined for different hepatocellular adenomas subtypes. The current study aimed to report the magnetic resonance imaging features of a well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma that developed on the basis of β-catenin activated hepatocellular adenomas in a child. In this case, atypical diffuse steatosis was determined in the lesion. In the literature, diffuse steatosis, which is defined as a feature of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α-inactivated hepatocellular adenomas subtype, has not been previously reported in any β-catenin activated hepatocellular adenomas case. Interlacing magnetic resonance imaging findings between subtypes show that there are still many mysteries about this topic and larger studies are warranted.",

Immunohistochemically, all cellular components were negative for carcinoembryonic antigen, but positive for p53. Both cholangiocytes and oval-shaped cells were immunoreactive to anti-cytokeratin antibodies AE1/AE3 and MNF116. In addition, cholangiocytes were exclusively immunoreactive to anti-cytokeratin antibody CAM5.2, and hepatocytes were positive for MNF116 and hepatocyte paraffin 1. All neoplastic cells were positive for the hepatic progenitor cell markers, α-1-fetoprotein, sal-like protein 4, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule. From these results, the present case was diagnosed as hepatocholangiocellular adenoma, arising from epithelial cells of the canals of Hering.",

    "Abstract": "Promoter mutations in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomere length have been studied in various tumors. In the present study, the frequency and clinical characteristics of TERT promoter mutation and telomere length were studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TERT promoter mutation and telomere length were analyzed in 162 tumor samples of the patients with HCC by sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. The TERT promoter mutation rate was 28.8% (46/160) in HCC and was associated with males (P = 0.027). The telomere length was not significantly different in the presence of a TERT promoter mutation but was shorter in high-grade tumor stages (P = 0.048). Survival analyses showed that poor overall survival was associated with longer telomere length (P = 0.013). However, the TERT promoter mutation did not have a prognostic value for HCC. Multivariate survival analyses demonstrated that the telomere length was an independent prognostic marker for poor overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.046-2.913, P = 0.033). These data demonstrated that TERT promoter mutation is a frequent event in HCC; however, telomere length, but not the presence of a TERT promoter mutation, might have potential value as a prognostic indicator of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "In an increasing proportion of cases, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Mutations in telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) are associated with familial liver diseases. The aim of this study was to examine telomere length and germline hTERT mutations as associated with NAFLD-HCC. In 40 patients with NAFLD-HCC, 45 with NAFLD-cirrhosis and 64 healthy controls, peripheral blood telomere length was evaluated by qRT-PCR and hTERT coding regions and intron-exon boundaries sequenced. We further analyzed 78 patients affected by primary liver cancer (NAFLD-PLC, 76 with HCC). Enrichment of rare coding mutations (allelic frequency <0.001) was evaluated by Burden test. Functional consequences were estimated in silico and by over-expressing protein variants in HEK-293 cells. We found that telomere length was reduced in individuals with NAFLD-HCC versus those with cirrhosis (P = 0.048) and healthy controls (P = 0.0006), independently of age and sex. We detected an enrichment of hTERT mutations in NAFLD-HCC, that was confirmed when we further considered a larger cohort of NAFLD-PLC, and was more marked in female patients (P = 0.03). No mutations were found in cirrhosis and local controls, and only one in 503 healthy Europeans from the 1000 Genomes Project (allelic frequency = 0.025 vs. <0.001; P = 0.0005). Mutations with predicted functional impact, including the frameshift Glu113Argfs*79 and missense Glu668Asp, cosegregated with liver disease in two families. Three patients carried missense mutations (Ala67Val in homozygosity, Pro193Leu and His296Pro in heterozygosity) in the N-terminal template-binding domain (P = 0.037 for specific enrichment). Besides Glu668Asp, the Ala67Val variant resulted in reduced intracellular protein levels. In conclusion, we detected an association between shorter telomeres in peripheral blood and rare germline hTERT mutations and NAFLD-HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Telomerase regulation and telomere shortening act as a strong tumor suppressor mechanism in human somatic cells. Point mutations in the promoter of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) are the most frequent non-coding mutation in cancer. These TERT promoter mutations (TPMs) create de novo ETS factor binding sites upstream of the start codon of the gene, which can be bound by different ETS factors. TPMs can occur early during tumorigenesis and are thought to be among the first mutations in melanoma, glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite their association with increased TERT levels, TPMs do not prohibit telomere shortening and TPM-harboring cancers present with short telomeres. Their short telomere length combined with their high prevalence and specificity for cancer makes TPMs an attractive target for future therapeutic exploitation of telomerase inhibition and telomere deprotection-induced cell death.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Recently, the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been prolonged with improvements in various diagnostic tools and medical treatment modalities. Consequently, spine metastases from HCC are being diagnosed more frequently. The accurate prediction of prognosis plays a critical role in determining a patient's treatment plan, including surgery for patients with spinal metastases of HCC. We investigated the clinical features, surgical outcomes, and prognostic factors of HCC presenting with spine metastases, in patients who underwent surgery. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on 33 HCC patients who underwent 36 operations (three patients underwent surgical treatment twice) from February 2006 to December 2013. The median age of the patients was 56 years old (range, 28 to 71; male : female=30 : 3). Results: Overall survival was not correlated with age, sex, level of metastases, preoperative Child-Pugh classification, preoperative ambulatory function, preoperative radiotherapy, type of operation, administration of Sorafenib, or the Tokuhashi scoring system. Only the Tomita scoring system was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Comparing the Child-Pugh classification and ambulatory ability, there were no statistically differences between patients pre- and post-operatively. Conclusion: The Tomita scoring system represents a practicable and highly predictive prognostic tool. Even though surgical intervention may not restore ambulatory function, it should be considered to prevent deterioration of the patient's overall condition. Additionally, aggressive management may be needed if there is any ambulatory ability remaining.",

    "Abstract": "RAD51D (RAD51L3) is a member of the RAD51 gene family which plays important roles in maintaining genomic stability and preventing DNA damage. This study is aimed to investigate the associations between RAD51D polymorphisms and the hereditary susceptibility of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study we conducted a hospital-based case-control study including 805 cases (HCC patients) and 846 controls (nontumor patients) in Guangxi, China. A total of two Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12947947 and rs28363292 of RAD51D were selected and genotyped. Although we did not find two SNPs individually that had any significant main effect on risk of HCC, We found that the combined genotypes with 1-2 risk genotypes were associated with significantly increased overall risk of HCC (OR = 1.462, 95% CI = 1.050-2.036). According to the results of further stratification analysis, GT/GG genotype of rs28363292 increased HCC risk in zhuang people (OR = 3.913, 95% CI = 1.873-8.175) and nonhepatitis B virus (HBV) infection population (OR = 1.774, 95% CI = 1.060-2.969), the combined 1-2 risk genotypes increased the risk of HCC in zhuang people (OR = 2.817, 95% CI = 1.532-5.182) and non-HBV infected population (OR = 1.567, 95% CI = 1.042-2.358). Our results suggest that rs12947947 and rs28363292 polymorphisms may jointly contribute to the risk of HCC. Further large studies and functional studies are required to validate our findings.",

    "Abstract": "A hierarchy of liver-enriched transcription factors plays an important role in activating expression of many hepatic genes. In particular, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) is a major activator of the gene encoding HNF-1, and HNF-1 itself activates expression of more than 20 liver genes. To dissect this activation pathway genetically, we prepared somatic cell variants that were deficient in expression of the liver-specific alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) gene, which requires both HNF-1 and HNF-4 for high-level gene activity. This was accomplished in two steps. First, hepatoma transfectants that stably expressed two selectable markers under alpha 1AT promoter control were prepared; second, variant sublines that could no longer express either transgene were isolated by direct selection. In this report, we demonstrate that the variants contain defects in the HNF-4/HNF-1 activation pathway. These defects functioned in trans, as expression of many liver genes was affected, but the variant phenotypes were recessive to wild type in somatic cell hybrids. Three different variant classes could be discriminated by their phenotypic responses to ectopic expression of either HNF-4 or HNF-1. Two variant clones appeared specifically deficient in HNF-4 expression, as transfection with an HNF-4 expression cassette fully restored their hepatic phenotypes. Another line activated HNF-1 in response to forced HNF-4 expression, but activation of downstream genes failed to occur. One clone was unresponsive to either HNF-1 or HNF-4. Using the variants, we demonstrate further that the chromosomal genes encoding alpha 1AT, aldolase B, and alpha-fibrinogen display strict requirements for HNF-1 activation in vivo, while other liver genes were unaffected by the presence or absence of HNF-1 or HNF-4. We also provide evidence for the existence of an autoregulatory loop in which HNF-1 regulates its own expression through activation of HNF-4.",

    "Abstract": "The genes encoding alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT, gene symbol P I) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) are part of a cluster of serine protease inhibitor (serpin) genes on human chromosome 14q32.1. Both genes are highly expressed in the liver and in cultured hepatoma cells, and the approximately 100-kb region around these genes contains an extensive array of expression-associated DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Activation of human alpha 1AT and CBG transcription occurred when human chromosome 14 was transferred from nonexpressing cells to rat hepatoma cells. This activation event was accompanied by long-range chromatin reorganization of the entire region and the de novo formation of 17 expression-associated DHSs. Both gene activation and chromatin remodeling in hepatic cells required the liver-enriched transactivators hepatocyte nuclear factors-1 alpha and -4 (HNF-1 alpha and HNF-4). In this study, we tested whether ectopic expression of HNF-1 alpha and HNF-4 in nonexpressing cells could activate alpha 1AT and/or CBG transcription, and we monitored the chromatin structure of the locus in stably transfected fibroblasts. We report that both alpha 1AT and CBG mRNAs were expressed in fibroblast transfectants that stably expressed HNF-1 alpha and HNF-4, but expression was only approximately 1-10% of that observed in hepatic cells. Gene activation in these cells was accompanied by partial chromatin remodeling, as 6 of 17 expression-associated DHSs were formed. The potential implications of these results are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha), a liver-specific transcription factor, plays a significant role in many liver-specific functions, including lipid, glucose, drug, and ammonia metabolism, and also in embryonal liver development. However, its functions and regulation are not yet clearly understood. In this study, we constructed an adenovirus vector carrying rat HNF-4alpha cDNA and transfected the adenovirus to human hepatoma cells, HuH-7, to enforce expression of the exogenous HNF-4alpha gene. We analyzed HNF-4alpha-induced genes using cDNA microarray technology, which included over 9000 genes. As a result, 62 genes showed a greater than 2.0-fold change in expression level after the viral transfection. Fifty-six genes were consistently induced by HNF-4alpha overexpression, and six genes were repressed. To assess HNF-4alpha function, we attempted to classify the genes, which had been classified by their encoding protein functions in a previous report. We could classify 45 genes. The rest of the HNF-4alpha-sensitive genes were unclassified (4 genes) or not identified (13 genes). Among the classified genes, almost half of the induced genes (26 of 40) were related to metabolism genes and particularly to lipid metabolism-related genes. This cDNA microarray analysis showed that HNF-4alpha is one of the central liver metabolism regulators.",

    "Abstract": "The Notch/Jagged signaling pathway is important for cellular differentiation and proliferation. Notch1/Jagged1 can either suppress or promote tumors depending on the cell type and context. beta-catenin, one of the mediators of the Wnt signalling pathway, represents a key element in one of the most important pathways of carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of Notch1/Jagged1 and beta-catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma and to assign clinicopathological correlations. Immunohistochemical detection of Notch1/Jagged1 and beta-catenin was performed in tissue microarrays including 339 Hepatocellular carcinomas, 174 adjacent non-tumor livers and 94 normal livers. The results showed that the rate of expression was 66%, 98% and 97% for Notch1 and 36%, 85% and 92% for Jagged1 respectively in hepatocellular carcinoma, adjacent non-tumor liver and normal liver. Decreased expression of Notch1/Jagged1 was correlated significantly with Edmondson-Steiner grade. However, nuclear beta-catenin was expressed in 37% of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, which was significantly higher than its non-tumor counterparts. Increased nuclear beta-catenin expression was correlated with HBs-Ag status and Edmondson-Steiner grade. Moreover, The positive expression of Notch1 was parallel with Jagged1 expression (r =0.235, p=0.000) and reduced Notch1 expression was associated with increased beta-catenin expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (r =-0.125, p =0.023). In conclusion, Notch1/Jagged1 were frequently low expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and correlated with the high expression of beta-catenin suggesting that downregulation of Notch1/Jagged1 signaling may sustain tumor progression.",

Recent reports suggest activity of erlotinib, an ErbB1 inhibitor, and lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Activating ErbB1 somatic mutations may predict treatment responses. Method and results: We have previously reported ErbB1 tyrosine kinase domain mutations to be rare or absent in HCC, but data on the frequency of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase domain mutations in HCC is currently limited, apart from reports of a missense mutation identified in 11% of a small Caucasian sample. We studied exons 18-23 of the ErbB2 gene from tumor DNA of 100 Asian human HCC and found no exonic mutations of potential significance.

Screening of candidate therapeutic agents by using patient-derived preclinical models may facilitate drug discovery for HCC patients. Methods: Four primary cultured HCC cells from surgically resected tumor tissues and six HCC cell lines were used for high-throughput screening of 252 drugs from the Prestwick Chemical Library. The efficacy and mechanisms of action of the candidate anti-cancer drug were analyzed via cell viability, cell cycle assays, and western blotting. Results: Guanabenz acetate, which has been used as an antihypertensive drug, was screened as a candidate anti-cancer agent for HCC through a drug sensitivity assay by using the primary cultured HCC cells and HCC cell lines. Guanabenz acetate reduced HCC cell viability through apoptosis and autophagy. This occurred via inhibition of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34, increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, increased activating transcription factor 4, and cell cycle arrest. Conclusions: Guanabenz acetate induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-related cell death in HCC and may be repositioned as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent for HCC patients.",

    "Abstract": "The INK4a-ARF (CDKN2A)- locus on chromosome 9p21 encodes for two tumour suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), that act as upstream regulators of the Rb-CDK4 and p53 pathways. To study the contribution of each pathway in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analysed the alterations of p14(ARF), p16(INC4a) and p53. After microdissection, DNA of 71 hepatocellular carcinomas was analysed for INK4-ARF inactivation and p53 mutation by DNA sequence analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), restriction-enzyme related polymerase chain reaction (RE-PCR), mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry. In addition, microdeletion of p14(ARF) and p16(INC4a) were assessed by differential PCR. Inactivation of p14(ARF) was found in 11/71 cases (15%), alterations of p16(INK4a) occurred in 47/71 carcinomas (66%), which correlated with loss of mRNA transcription. Five tumours (7%) had homozygous deletions of the INK4a-ARF locus. We failed to detect specific mutations of both exons. P16(INK4a) methylation with an unmethylated p14(ARF) promotor appeared in 39 cases. Mutations of p53 were found in 30 of 71 HCC (42%), and only one of them harboured p14(ARF) inactivation. We failed to establish alterations of the INK4a-ARF locus or p53 status as independent prognostic factor in these tumours. Our data indicate, that p14(ARF) methylation occurs independently of p16(INK4a) alterations in a subset of HCC together with wild type p53. The INK4a-ARF-/p53-pathway was disrupted in 86% of HCC, either by p53 mutations or by INK4a-ARF inactivation, and may have co-operative effects in hepatocarcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The prevalence of homologous recombination DNA damage repair (HR-DDR) deficiencies among all tumor lineages is not well characterized. Therapy directed toward homologous recombination DDR deficiency (HRD) is now approved in ovarian and breast cancer, and there may be additional opportunities for benefit for patients with other cancers. Comprehensive evaluations for HRD are limited in part by the lack of a uniform, cost-effective method for testing and defining HRD. Methods: Molecular profiles of 52,426 tumors were reviewed to identify pathogenic mutations in the HR-DDR genes ARID1A, ATM, ATRX, BAP1, BARD1, BLM, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, CHEK1/2, FANCA/C/D2/E/F/G/L, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51, RAD51B, or WRN. From solid tumors submitted to Caris Life Sciences, molecular profiles were generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS; average read depth, 500×). A total of 17,566 tumors were sequenced with NGS600 (n = 592 genes), and 34,860 tumors underwent hotspot Illumina MiSeq platform testing (n = 47 genes). Results: Of the tumors that underwent NGS600 testing, the overall frequency of HRDDR mutations detected was 17.4%, and the most commonly mutated lineages were endometrial (34.4%; n = 1,475), biliary tract (28.9%; n = 343), bladder (23.9%; n = 201), hepatocellular (20.9%; n = 115), gastroesophageal (20.8%; n = 619), and ovarian (20.0%; n = 2,489). Least commonly mutated lineages included GI stromal (3.7%; n = 108), head and neck (6.8%; n = 206), and sarcoma (9.3%; n = 592). ARID1A was the most commonly mutated gene (7.2%), followed by BRCA2 (3.0%), BRCA1 (2.8%), ATM (1.3%), ATRX (1.3%), and CHEK2 (1.3%). Conclusions: HR-DDR mutations were seen in 17.4% of tumors across 21 cancer lineages, providing a path to explore the role of HRD-directed therapies, including poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors, DNA-damaging chemotherapies, and newer agents such as ATR inhibitors.",

Genetic alterations of p14ARF and their relationship with p16(INK4a) or p53 inactivation have not been characterized in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined 40 pairs of HCCs/noncancerous liver tissues for homozygous deletions (HD), methylation and mutations of the INK4a/ARF locus and for mutations of p53, and analyzed their clinicopathological correlation. p16(INK4a), p53 and p14(ARF) were inactivated in 62.5% (25 out of 40), 42.5% (17 out of 40) and 20% (8 out of 40) of HCCs, respectively. Inactivation of p14(ARF) was always associated with the concomitant inactivation of p16(INK4a) and occurred more frequently in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated HCC (p=0.042). Inactivation of p16INK4a) occurred more frequently in older patients (p=0.0027. The predominant mechanism of inactivation of p14(ARF) was homozygous deletion (7 out of 8), while that of p16(INK4a) was methylation (21 out of 25). Although statistically insignificant, genetic alterations of p14(ARF) tended to occur in tumors with wild-type p53. Genetic alterations of the INK4alpha/ARF locus could occur in small HCCs. In contrast, p53 mutations occurred more frequently in advanced HCCs (p=0.041). Inactivation of either p14(ARF)/p53 or p16(INK4a) occurred in 80% (32 out of 40) and concomitant disruption of both pathways occurred in 40% (16 out of 40) of HCCs, respectively. These results suggest that p14(ARF), p16(INK4a) and p53 are differentially disrupted through distinct molecular mechanisms at different stages in HCC and that p14(ARF) and p53 appear to function in the same tumor suppression pathway in HCC",

    "Abstract": "Background: During cup implantation, vertical height of the cup center (V-HCC) should be precisely controlled to achieve sufficient bone-cup coverage (BCC). Our study aimed to investigate the acetabular bone stock and the quantitative relationship between V-HCC and BCC in Crowe types I to III hips. Methods: From November 2013 to March 2016, pelvic models of 51 patients (61 hips) with hip dysplasia were retrospectively reconstructed using a computer software. Acetabular height and doom thickness were measured on the mid-acetabular coronal cross section. V-HCC was defined as the vertical distance of cup rotational center to the interteardrop line (ITL). In the cup implantation simulation, the cup was placed at the initial preset position, with a V-HCC of 15 mm, and moved proximally by 3-mm increments. At each level, the BCC was automatically calculated by computer. Analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare the differences between groups. Results: There were no significant between-group differences in maximum thickness of the acetabular doom; however, peak bone stock values were obtained at heights of 41.63 ± 5.14 mm (Crowe type I), 47.58 ± 4.10 mm (Crowe type II), and 55.78 ± 3.64 mm (Crowe type III) above the ITL. At 15 mm of V-HCC, median BCC was 78% (75-83%) (Crowe type I), 74% (66-71%) (Crowe type II), and 61% (57-68%) (Crowe type III). To achieve 80% of the BCC, the median V-HCC was 16.27 (15.00-16.93) mm, 18.19 (15.01-21.53) mm, and 24.13 (21.02-28.70) mm for Crowe types I, II, and III hips, respectively. Conclusion: During acetabular reconstruction, slightly superior placement with V-HCC <25 mm retained sufficient bone coverage in Crowe I to III hips.",

    "Abstract": "Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been used as a non-invasive biomarker for detecting cancer-specific mutations. However, the mutational profile of cfDNA in Thai patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated the utility of using whole-exome sequencing (WES) of cfDNA to define the somatic mutation profiles of HCC in Thai patients. The comprehensive profile of cfDNA was determined with WES to identify variants in matched cfDNA and germline DNA from 30 HCC patients in Thailand who underwent nonoperative therapies. The level of cfDNA was higher in HCC patients compared with chronic hepatitis patients (p-value < 0.001). Single nucleotide variants were present in somatic genes in cfDNA, including in ZNF814 (27%), HRNR (20%), ZNF492 (20%), ADAMTS12 (17%), FLG (17%), OBSCN (17%), TP53 (17%), and TTN (17%). These same mutations were matched to HCC mutation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and a previous Thai HCC study. The co-occurrence of HRNR and TTN mutations in cfDNA was associated with shorter overall survival in HCC patients (hazard ratio = 1.60, p-value = 0.0196). These findings indicate that the mutational profile of cfDNA accurately reflected that of HCC tissue and suggest that cfDNA could serve as a useful biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in Thai HCC patients. In addition, we demonstrated the use of the pocket-sized sequencer of Oxford Nanopore Technology to detect copy-number variants in HCC tissues that could be applied for onsite clinical detection/monitoring of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the Middle East is increasing in parallel to an increase in the prevalence of associated risk factors such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. About 20% to 30% of the patients progress to develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a histological subtype of NAFLD, with features of hepatocyte injury such as hepatocyte ballooning. NASH can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD thus causes a substantial burden on healthcare systems and it is imperative that appropriate strategies are discussed at a regional level to facilitate effective management tailored to the needs of the region. To fulfil this unmet need, expert gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and endocrinologists from the region came together in three advisory board meetings that were conducted in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, to discuss current local challenges in NAFLD screening and diagnosis, and the different available management options. The experts discussed the disease burden of NAFLD/NASH in the Middle East; screening, diagnosis, and referral patterns in NAFLD; and available treatment options for NAFLD and NASH. This paper summarizes the discussions and opinion of the expert panel on the management of NAFLD/NASH and also presents an extensive literature review on the topic.",

Materials and methods: ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WERE AS FOLLOWS: newly diagnosed with HCC, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C, Child-Pugh class A or B, and no prior treatment for HCC. Patients with extrahepatic spread were excluded. A total of 59 patients were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were treated with TACE followed by RT. The time interval between TACE and RT was 2 weeks as per protocol. A median RT dose was 47.25 Gy10 as the biologically effective dose using the α/β = 10 (range, 39 to 65.25 Gy10). Results: At 1 month, complete response was obtained in 3 patients (5%), partial response in 27 patients (46%), stable disease in 13 patients (22%), and progressive disease in 16 patients (27%). The actuarial one- and two-year OS rates were 60.1% and 47.2%, respectively. The median OS was 17 months (95% confidence interval, 5.6 to 28.4 months). The median time to progression was 4 months (range, 1 to 35 months). Grade 3 or greater liver enzyme elevation occurred in only two patients (3%) after RT. Grade 3 gastroduodenal toxicity developed in two patients (3%). Conclusion: The combination treatment of TACE followed by RT with two-week interval was safe and it showed favorable outcomes in treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced HCC. A prospective randomized trial is needed to validate these results.",

    "Abstract": "Background: SWELL1 was recently demonstrated to be an indispensable part of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). VRAC is reported to participate in cell proliferation, survival, and migration. However, the correlation between SWELL1 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly-understood. In this study, we tried to explore the role of SWELL1 in HCC. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure SWELL1 expression in HCC samples obtained from patients with HCC. The effects of SWELL1 on HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis were analysed by corresponding cytological experiments including Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), colony-forming, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), cell cycle analysis, TUNEL, Annexin V and PI staining, wound healing, transwell, and so on. BALB/c nude mice were used for the in vivo assays. qRT-PCR and western blotting was performed for molecular mechanisms. Findings: SWELL1 was highly expressed in HCC tissues, and related to the poor prognosis. In vitro, the over-expression of SWELL1 significantly induced cell proliferation and migration, and inhibited apoptosis, whereas suppressing SWELL1 had the opposite effects. Moreover, knockdown of SWELL1 suppressed the growth and metastasis of HCC in vivo. Further experiments revealed that SWELL1 induced cell growth by activating the cyclinD1/CDK2 pathway via the connection with PKCa at the signalling level, and regulated cell migration through the JNK pathway in HCC. Interpretation: SWELL1 acts as a promoter in the growth and metastasis of HCC cells and may be a potential intervention target for HCC.

We report the case of a 61-year-old male with multiple HCCs caused by alcohol-related cirrhosis, who was admitted for rapid development of abdominal fullness. The diagnosis was established by hemorrhagic ascites by abdominal paracentesis. No clear extravasation was found on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. CEUS using the re-injection method in the post-vascular phase showed active bleeding from a lesion close to the S5 gallbladder bed. Abdominal angiography was urgently performed. Based on CEUS findings, selective cannulation of the cystic artery was performed. Cystic angiography findings with carbon dioxide showed extravasation. He was treated by TAE. Our case had multiple HCCs, but CEUS was useful for the identification of bleeding sites.",

    "Abstract": "Background: There is a growing literature on the significance of systemic immune-inflammation index in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the results were inconsistent due to the small sample size and different study endpoints. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to further systematically and comprehensively verify the prognostic role of the SII in HCC. Methods: Several databases were searched systematically, and relevant papers were selected. The main outcome measure was overall survival (OS); the secondary outcome measure was a composite of time to recurrence (TTR), progression-free survival (PFS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results: Ten published retrospective studies involving 2796 HCC patients were included. The results revealed that elevated pre-treatment SII was related to lower OS (HR:1.54, P < .001) and earlier TTR (HR:1.77, P < .001). Conclusions: Elevated SII is a poor prognostic factor for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical application of SII is encouraged to evaluate the progress of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of perfluorobutane microbubbles (Sonazoid®, GE Healthcare) on steam popping during radiofrequency (RF) ablation for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to assess whether popping affects treatment outcomes. Materials and methods: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, which included 90 consecutive patients with single HCC, who received percutaneous RF ablation as the first-line treatment. The patients were divided into two groups, based on the presence or absence of the popping phenomenon, which was defined as an audible sound with a simultaneous sudden explosion within the ablation zone as detected via ultrasonography during the procedure. The factors contributing to the popping phenomenon were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Local tumor progression (LTP) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test for performing comparisons between the two groups. Results: The overall incidence of the popping phenomenon was 25.8% (24/93). Sonazoid® was used in 1 patient (4.2%) in the popping group (n = 24), while it was used in 15 patients (21.7%) in the non-popping group (n = 69). Multivariable analysis revealed that the use of Sonazoid® was the only significant factor for absence of the popping phenomenon (odds ratio = 0.10, p = 0.048). There were no significant differences in cumulative LTP and DFS between the two groups (p = 0.479 and p = 0.424, respectively). Conclusion: The use of Sonazoid® has a suppressive effect on the popping phenomenon during RF ablation in patients with HCC. However, the presence of the popping phenomenon may not affect clinical outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Liver transplantation represents the only curative option for patients with end-stage liver disease, fulminant hepatitis and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Even though major advances in transplantation in the last decades have achieved excellent survival rates in the early post-transplantation period, long-term survival is hampered by the lack of improvement in survival in the late post transplantation period (over 5 years after transplantation). The main etiologies for late mortality are malignancies and cardiovascular complications. The latter are increasingly prevalent in liver transplant recipients due to the development or worsening of metabolic syndrome and all its components (arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, renal injury, etc.). These comorbidities result from a combination of pre-liver transplant features, immunosuppressive agent side-effects, changes in metabolism and hemodynamics after liver transplantation and the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle. In this review we describe the most prevalent metabolic and cardiovascular complications present after liver transplantation, as well as proposing management strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the chronic inflammatory liver diseases and a leading cause of advanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The main purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of GBCK25 fermented by Saccharomyces servazzii GB-07 and pectinase, on NASH severity in mice. Methods: Six-wk-old male mice were fed either a normal diet (ND) or a Western diet (WD) for 12 wks to induce NASH. Each group was orally administered with vehicle or GBCK25 once daily at a dose of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, or 400 mg/kg during that time. The effects of GBCK25 on cellular damage and inflammation were determined by in vitro experiments. Results: Histopathologic analysis and hepatic/serum biochemical levels revealed that WD-fed mice showed severe steatosis and liver injury compared to ND-fed mice. Such lesions were significantly decreased in the livers of WD-fed mice with GBCK25 administration. Consistently, mRNA expression levels of NASH-related inflammatory-, fibrogenic-, and lipid metabolism-related genes were decreased in the livers of WD-fed mice administered with GBCK25 compared to WD-fed mice. Western blot analysis revealed decreased protein levels of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) with concomitantly reduced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the livers of WD-fed mice administered with GBCK25. Also, decreased cellular damage and inflammation were observed in alpha mouse liver 12 (AML12) cells and RAW264.7 cells, respectively. Conclusion: Administration of GBCK25 ameliorates NASH severity through the modulation of CYP2E1 and its associated JNK-mediated cellular damage. GBCK25 could be a potentially effective prophylactic strategy to prevent metabolic diseases including NASH.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Chemotherapy resistance is the main cause of poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of adriamycin (ADM) resistance in HCC. Increasing evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial regulatory role in different pathological processes. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the roles and the underlying molecular mechanism of circFoxo3 in ADM-resistant HCC. Materials and methods: Twenty-five pairs of clinical tumors samples and matched normal tissues were collected from patients with HCC. Gain- and loss-function experiments were performed to investigate the role of circFoxo3 in ADM-resistant cells. Results: CircFoxo3 expression was increased in ADM-resistant HCC tissues and HCC cell lines and in metastatic tissues compared with non-metastatic tissues. CircFoxo3 knockdown reduces and circFoxo3 overexpression enhances HCC cell invasion and tumor growth. In addition, circFoxo3 interacted with miR-199a-5p and regulated miR-199a-5p expression. Furthermore, ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 1 (ABCC1) was identified as a new target of miR-199a-5p. CircFoxo3 interacted with miR-199a-5p to positively regulate ABCC1 expression, contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression. Conclusion: CircFoxo3 knockdown reduces and circFoxo3 overexpression enhances HCC cell invasion and tumor growth through regulation of miR-199a-5p/ABCC1 axis. Our findings reveal that circFoxo3 may be novel biomarkers and therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Von Meyenburg complexes (VMCs) are a rare type of ductal plate malformation. We herein report two Chinese families with VMCs, and the suspicious gene mutation of this disease. Proband A was a 62-year-old woman with abnormal echographic presentation of the liver. She received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination and liver biopsy, and the results showed she had VMCs. Histologically proved hepatocellular carcinoma was found 1 year after the diagnosis of VMCs. Proband B was a 57-year-old woman with intrahepatic diffuse lesions displayed by abdominal ultrasonography. Her final diagnoses were VMCs, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and hepatitis B surface e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B after a series of examinations. Then, all the family members of both proband A and proband B were screened for VMCs by MRI or ultrasonography. The results showed that four of the 11 family members from two families, including two males and two females, were diagnosed with VMCs. DNA samples were extracted from the peripheral blood of those 11 individuals of two VMCs pedigrees and subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification of the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene. Two different mutation loci were identified. Heterozygous mutations located in exon 32 (c.4280delG, p.Gly1427ValfsX6) in family A and exon 28 (c.3118C>T, p.Arg1040Ter) in family B were detected. We speculate that PKHD1 gene mutations may be responsible for the development of VMCs.",

    "Abstract": "Alteration of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) type II receptor (RII) appears to cause unresponsiveness to TGF-beta1 in tumorigenic cells. Defect in the mononucleotide repeat sequence, i.e., poly A region of TGF-beta1RII gene has been reported to be related to replication error-positive cancer cells. We examined if there is any TGF-beta1RII mutation in a coding microsatellite in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genomic DNAs were extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tissues obtained at surgery or autopsy in 3 normal individuals and 96 patients with hepatitis C virus-induced chronic liver disease; 3 with chronic hepatitis, 20 with liver cirrhosis and 73 with HCC. The DNA was PCR-amplified at 2 segments of TGF-beta1RII: poly A region which includes the (A)10 microsatellite sequence, and poly GT region. PCR products were directly sequenced. DNA from normal and patients with chronic liver disease contained the 10 wild-type adenines but 3 cases with liver cirrhosis in whom there were only 9 adenines within poly A tract. This microdeletion of one A resulted in a frameshift and truncated a predicted length of amino acids. In HCC lesions, the same deletion was noted in 4 cases (25%) of well-differentiated type, 10 (40%) of moderately differentiated type, 18 (53%) of poorly differentiated type. None of the lesions had mutations within the GT region. Our findings indicate that one adenine deletion of poly A microsatellite tract within TGF-beta1RII is frequently detected in patients with HCC, and the mutation may cause the abrogation of the function of TGF-beta1RII gene.",

Different agents including checkpoint inhibitors, TKIs and anti-VEGFR antibodies demonstrated efficacy in treatment. For the first time, the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, a first-line treatment that is superior to the current standard was identified, potentially changing the way we treat HCC. In this review, we summarize current data on systemic treatment of patients with advanced HCC, focusing on combination therapies comprising immune checkpoint inhibitors, TKIs and locoregional therapies. We elucidate findings from recent trials and discuss such challenges as the lack of predictive biomarkers for identification of subgroups that will benefit from novel treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "It has been suggested that genetic changes in cancers are related to genomic instability. To evaluate a possible correlation between growth-regulatory genes and genomic instability in HCC, we investigated microsatellite instability and mutations of TGF-beta type II receptor (TGF-beta RII) and E2F-4 genes in each pair of tumor and surrounding nontumor liver tissues, collected from 19 patients with HCC. By the identification of mutations in six different genetic loci (D1S170, D2S123, D4S395, D13S126, D13S260, and D16S402), one or more alterations in microsatellite markers were identified in 13/19 (68%) hepatocellular carcinoma specimens. When two repeated sequences of TGF-beta RII gene, poly(A)(10) tract in exon 8 and poly(GT)(3) tract in exon 9, were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism, none of the 19 hepatocellular carcinoma specimens showed mutations. When amplicons of poly(AGC)(13) tract of E2F-4 were analyzed by cloning and automated sequencing, 5/19 (36%) hepatocellular carcinomas showed deletion mutation in one or two AGC repeats and such mutations were identified only among cases with microsatellite instability. These results suggest that both microsatellite instability and mutations of E2F-4 occur commonly in hepatocellular carcinoma and play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: We evaluated the capability of \"microRNA sponges\" in sequestering and inhibiting the over-expressed miR-221 in HCC cell lines. Background: Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious public health problem, with no effective cure at present. It has been demonstrated that the deregulation of microRNAs expression contributes to tumorigenesis. In HCC, miR-221 was shown to be up-regulated in more than 70% of the cases and was associated with higher tumor stage, metastasis and a shorter time to recurrence after surgery, suggesting an important pathogenic role. A tumor promoting function of miR-221 was proved in a transgenic mouse model, which was predisposed to the development of liver cancers. These findings suggested that miR-221 could represent a potential target for anti-tumor approaches. Material and methods: Novel adeno and adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) were developed: they were genetically modified to drive the expression of multiple binding sites for miR-221, the \"miR-221 sponge\", which was designed to sequester miR-221 cellular molecules. Results: Analysis of viral vectors activity in HCC cells revealed their capability to reduce miR-221 endogenous levels, which was accompanied by the increase in CDKN1B/ p27 protein, a known target of miR-221. An increase in apoptosis was also measured in Hep3B cells after infection with any of the two viral vectors in comparison with control vectors, with stronger effects induced by adenovirus compared to AAV vectors. Conclusion: The depletion of oncogenic microRNAs represents a potential anti-cancer approach that needs to be tested for safety and efficacy. Here, we describe the development of novel \"miR-221 sponge\" vectors, which can reduce miR-221 activity in vitro and may be used for in vivo delivery.",

    "Abstract": "N-α-acetyltransferase 20 (Naa20), which is a catalytic subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase B (NatB) complex, has recently been reported to be implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and autophagy, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that based on bioinformatic analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets, Naa20 expression is much higher in HCC tumors than in normal tissues, promoting oncogenic properties in HCC cells. Mechanistically, Naa20 inhibits the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to promote the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway, which contributes to cell proliferation, as well as autophagy, through its N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) activity. We further show that liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a major regulator of AMPK activity, can be N-terminally acetylated by NatB in vitro, but also probably by NatB and/or other members of the NAT family in vivo, which may have a negative effect on AMPK activity through downregulation of LKB1 phosphorylation at S428. Indeed, p-LKB1 (S428) and p-AMPK levels are enhanced in Naa20-deficient cells, as well as in cells expressing the nonacetylated LKB1-MPE mutant; moreover, importantly, LKB1 deficiency reverses the molecular and cellular events driven by Naa20 knockdown. Taken together, our findings suggest that N-terminal acetylation of LKB1 by Naa20 may inhibit the LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway, which contributes to tumorigenesis and autophagy in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Mushrooms have been valued for their nutritive content and as traditional medicines; several important medicinal properties of mushrooms have been recognized worldwide. Objective: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the cell growth inhibitory potential of four edible mushrooms; Coprinus comatus (O.F. Mull.) Pers. (Agaricaceae), Tricholoma fracticum (Britzelm.) Kreisel (Tricholomataceae), Rhizopogon luteolus Fr. and Nordholm (Rhizopogonaceae), Lentinus tigrinus (Bull.) Fr. (Polyporaceae) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in conjunction with their antioxidant and antibacterial capacities. Materials and methods: Five different extracts of edible mushrooms were obtained using water, methanol, acetone, n-hexane and chloroform as solvent systems for cytotoxic, antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Results: C. comatus showed substantial in vitro cytotoxic activity against HepG2 cell lines with all extracts especially with chloroform 50% inhibition (IC50 value of 0.086 mg/ml) and acetone (IC50 value of 0.420 mg/ml). Chloroform extract of C. comatus had maximum amount of β-carotene (25.94 μg/mg), total phenolic content (76.32 μg/mg) and lycopene (12.00 μg/mg), and n-hexane extract of L. tigrinus had maximum amount of flavonoid (3.67 μg/mg). While chloroform extract of C. comatus showed the highest 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) capturing activity (1.579 mg/ml), the best result for metal chelating activity was obtained from methanolic extract (0.842 mg/ml). Moreover, all tested mushrooms demonstrated antibacterial activity and n-hexane extract of L. tigrinus and acetone extracts of T. fracticum were the most active against tested microorganism. Conclusion: These results indicate that different extracts of investigated mushroom have considerable cytotoxic, antioxidant and antibacterial properties and may be utilized as a promising source of therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "Aims/background: Microsatellite instability was sought in 10 human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) to determine whether defective DNA mismatch repair might be implicated in the multiple genetic alterations observed in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in some of these patients' tumors. Methods: Genomic DNA from HCCs and adjacent nontumorous livers was subjected to PCR with primers for nine microsatellites, and PCR products were resolved in a denaturing gel. Microsatellite instability was defined as the presence of band shifts or additional bands for at least two microsatellite sequences in an HCC compared to the nontumorous liver tissue from the same patient. Results: Microsatellite instability was detected in four of ten HCCs. Three of these four HCCs did not have p53 exon mutations. However, one HCC had microsatellite instability as well as multiple p53 exon mutations and multiple intron alterations. Four other patients with multiple p53 intron alterations in HCC (compared to their own nontumorous liver), three of whom also had a mutation in the exons, had no microsatellite instability. Conclusions: Defective DNA mismatch repair, as indicated by microsatellite instability, might have played a role in hepatocarcinogenesis in four of the ten patients, but in general it was not associated with p53 alterations. In one of the ten patients, defective DNA mismatch repair might have been the cause of multiple mutations in both the coding and intron sequences of the p53 gene.",

We tested this hypothesis in patients from a randomized phase II trial of everolimus versus sunitinib. Patients and methods: Archival specimens collected at baseline were analyzed with targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Focus of interest were alterations in key PI3K pathway components. PTEN expression was assessed by IHC. Association between molecular findings and treatment outcomes was investigated; same associations were tested for 2 everolimus-treated trial cohorts in gastric and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Results: Among 184 everolimus-treated patients with RCC with NGS data, mutation rates in genes of interest were 6% (TSC1), 4.4% (TSC2), and 8.2% (mTOR); 44% harbored alterations in ≥1 PI3K pathway component. For subjects with presence versus absence of mutations in TSC1, TSC2, or mTOR progression-free survival (PFS) neither differed on univariate analysis (HR, 1.0; P = 0.895) nor on multivariate testing stratified by MSKCC risk group and other established prognostic factors (HR, 1.1; P = 0.806). Everolimus-treated patients with retained (n = 50) versus lost (n = 50) PTEN IHC expression had median PFS of 5.3 months versus 10.5 months (HR, 2.5; P < 0.001). Such differences were not seen with sunitinib (10.9 months vs. 10.3 months; HR, 0.8; P = 0.475). Molecular findings did not correlate with outcomes in gastric and HCC cohorts. Conclusions: Association between mutation status for TSC1/TSC2/mTOR and therapeutic outcome on everolimus was not confirmed. Clinically meaningful differences in PFS were seen based on PTEN expression by IHC, lost in >50% of patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: This study aimed to elucidate the clinical importance of muscle volume loss (pre-sarcopenia) in patients receiving lenvatinib as treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC). Methods: Of 437 u-HCC patients treated with lenvatinib at specific institutions in Japan between March 2018 and May 2020, 151 with available computed tomography imaging data from the time of lenvatinib introduction were enrolled. Pre-sarcopenia was diagnosed based on a previously reported cut-off value calculation formula [psoas muscle area at level of middle of third lumbar vertebra (cm2 )/height (m)2 ]. Clinical features and prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) with inverse probability weighting were investigated retrospectively for their relationship with pre-sarcopenia. Results: Cox hazard multivariate analysis showed alpha-fetoprotein (≥400 ng/mL) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.271, P < 0.001), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (C and D) (HR 1.625, P = 0.018), and positive for pre-sarcopenia (HR 1.652, P = 0.042) to be significant prognostic factors. OS rates for the pre-sarcopenia group (n = 41) were worse than those for the non-pre-sarcopenia group (n = 110) (0.5-, 1-, and 1.5-year OS: 72.5%, 27.9%, and 7.0% vs 80.7%, 56.7%, and 46.1%, respectively; P < 0.001), as was progression-free survival (P = 0.025). Time to stopping lenvatinib or disease progression was better in the non-pre-sarcopenia group (0.5-, 1-, and 1.5-year OS: 48.0%, 24.5%, and 8.4% vs 20.0%, 10.3%, and 4.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). Also, the frequency of the adverse event appetite loss (any grade) was greater in the pre-sarcopenia group (43.9% vs 18.2%, P = 0.003). Conclusion: Pre-sarcopenia was shown to be a significant prognostic factor in patients treated with lenvatinib for u-HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system preserves genomic stability by identifying and repairing mismatched nucleotides in the DNA replication process. The dysfunction of the MMR system, also known as mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), is implicated as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy regardless of the tumor type in humans. This study aimed to evaluate the immunolabeling of MMR proteins in canine tumors and to identify the types of tumors having dMMR. First, we performed immunohistochemistry in 8 different canine tumors (oral malignant melanoma, high-to-intermediate grade lymphoma, mast cell tumor, malignant mammary gland tumor, urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and hemangiosarcoma) with 15 samples each to analyze the immunolabeling of canine mismatch repair proteins (MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1) using anti-human monoclonal antibodies. We found that more than half of canine oral malignant melanoma (60%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (53%) samples and fewer of the other canine tumors had loss of immunolabeling in ≥1 MMR protein (ie, evidence of defective MMR proteins, based on the definition of dMMR in the humans). Antibodies against human MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1 were cross-reactive with the corresponding canine protein as confirmed using MMR gene knockout canine cell lines. Further studies are required to investigate the clinical outcomes in canine spontaneous tumors with dMMR to determine the potential for immune checkpoint blockade therapy for these tumor types.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The current chemotherapeutic outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not encouraging, and long-term survival of this patient group remains poor. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of histone deacetylase inhibitors that can disrupt cell proliferation and survival in HCC management. However, the effects of droxinostat, a type of histone deacetylase inhibitor, on HCC remain to be established. Methods: The effects of droxinostat on HCC cell lines SMMC-7721 and HepG2 were investigated. Histone acetylation and apoptosis-modulating proteins were assessed via Western blot. Proliferation was examined with 3-(4, 5 dimetyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl 2H-tetrazolium bromide, cell proliferation, and real-time cell viability assays, and apoptosis with flow cytometry. Results: Droxinostat inhibited proliferation and colony formation of the HCC cell lines examined. Hepatoma cell death was induced through activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and downregulation of FLIP expression. Droxinostat suppressed histone deacetylase (HDAC) 3 expression and promoted acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Knockdown of HDAC3 induced hepatoma cell apoptosis and histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Conclusions: Droxinostat suppresses HDAC3 expression and induces histone acetylation and HCC cell death through activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and downregulation of FLIP, supporting its potential application in the treatment of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Many plants growing in Saudi Arabia are used in folk medicine for treatment of several diseases. Objective: Information of the chemical constituents and biological activities of plants is desirable for the discovery of therapeutic agents and discovering the actual value of folkloric remedies. Materials and methods: The compounds were isolated and purified using silica gel column chromatography and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) Method. The alcoholic extracts of these plants were evaluated for biological activities. Results: Isolation and characterization of 1-feruloyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (1) as well as new secondary metabolite tryptophan methyl ester (2) were isolated for the 1(st) time from the Horwoodia dicksoniae. The three flavones were isolated from Rumex cyprius identified as isoorientin (3), vitexin (4), and Cynarosid (5). The structures of these compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry analysis and comparing with literature. The compounds were isolated and purified using silica gel column chromatography and preparative HPLC-DAD Method. The alcoholic extracts of these plants were evaluated for antimicrobial activities against two Gram-positive bacteria, two Gram-negative bacteria, and four pathogenic fungi. Both plants showed good activities against Syncephalastrum racemosum and Streptococcus pneumoniae with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 0.98 and 1.95 μg/mL, respectively. H. dicksoniae showed good activity against Aspergillus fumigates with an MIC 1.95 μg/mL. The two extracts showed also effective free radical scavenging activities in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay. H. dicksoniae exhibited remarkable cytotoxic activity against Human breast cancer mammary cancer cells-7, Human liver cancer human hepatoma carcinoma cells-2, and human lung carcinoma (A-549) cell lines. Conclusions: It was suggested that further work should be carried out to isolate, purify, and characterize the active constituents responsible for the activity of these plants. Summary: New secondary metabolite Tryptophane methyl ester as well as 1-feruloyl-β-D-glucopyranoside were isolated for the first time from the HD.Isoorientin, vitexin and Cynarosid were isolated from RC.HD exhibited good activity against Aspergillus fumigates with an MIC 1.95 µg mL(-1).HD showed significant cytotoxic activity against Human breast cancer (MCF-7), Human liver cancer (HepG-2) and Human lung carcinoma (A-549) cell lines.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study was designed to analyze factors related to the success of salvage liver transplantation (SLT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While liver resection (LR) is considered the best locoregional therapy in HCC, there is a high recurrence rate. SLT may be the best treatment option when feasible. Methods: Patients who underwent living donor SLT for recurrent HCC after LR from November 1996 to May 2017 were included. Patient demographic data, clinical and pathologic characteristics, operative data, hospital course, and follow-up data regarding initial LR, locoregional therapy after recurrence and SLT were reviewed. Prognostic factors for recurrence were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard ratio. Results: Eighty-five of 123 SLT patients were included. Patients who had five or more locoregional therapies prior to SLT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-9.64, P = 0.006), hepatitis B (HR, 9.20; 95% CI, 1.13-74.89; P = 0.04), outside Milan criteria at the time of SLT (HR, 2.66, 95% CI, 1.26-5.63; P = 0.011) and an alpha-fetoprotein level above 1,000 ng/mL at the time of recurrence after initial LR (HR, 6.48; 95% CI, 1.83-22.92; P = 0.004) and at the time of transplantation (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.26-5.63; P = 0.011) were related to significant risk of recurrence.

    "Abstract": "Members of the Janus kinase (Jak) family of protein tyrosine kinases have recently been implicated in the proximal signal transduction events of cytokine receptors. Jak3, a newly discovered member of this family, is believed to be normally limited in its expression to cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Herein we show that Jak3 is expressed in primary human vascular cells, as well as other non-lymphoid and non-myeloid cell types. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis revealed that Jak3 mRNA was expressed at low levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC), A549 (human lung carcinoma), and DLD-1 (human colon adenocarcinoma) cells. Higher basal levels of Jak3 mRNA were detected in HMEC-1 (human microvascular cell line) and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells. Jak3 mRNA expression was induced in HUVEC, HMEC-1, and HASMC by treatment with interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and lipopolysaccharide. Jak3 protein was detectable at low levels in untreated HMEC-1, and these levels increased significantly with cytokine treatment. Furthermore, Jak3 protein was phosphorylated upon treatment of these cells with interleukin-4. This work shows that Jak3 is expressed or inducible in human vascular endothelial, vascular smooth muscle, and other non-lymphoid and non-myeloid cells, suggesting a broader role for Jak3 in the cytokine signal transduction of these cells.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Targeted therapy based on pathway analysis of hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be a promising remedy. Case summary: The present case involved an advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient who did not receive local regional therapy and was intolerant to sorafenib. Total RNA extracted from the patient's tumor tissue was used to obtain the gene mutation profile. The c.3676A>T and c.4402A>T stop-gain mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) were the most prevalent (42.2% and 35.1%, respectively). MutationMapper analysis indicated that the functional domain of APC was lost in the two APC mutant genes. APC is a major suppressor of the Wnt signaling pathway. Thus, the Wnt pathway was exclusively activated due to APC dysfunction, as other elements of this pathway were not found to be mutated. Aspirin has been reported to suppress the Wnt pathway by inducing β-catenin phosphorylation through the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta via cyclooxygenase-2 pathway inhibition. Therefore, aspirin was administered to the patient, which achieved four years of disease control. Conclusion: Exclusive mutations of APC of all the Wnt pathway elements could be a therapeutic target in HCC, with aspirin as an effective treatment option.",

    "Abstract": "High circulating fibrinogen levels correlate with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Fibrinogen levels vary between people and also change in response to physiological and environmental stimuli. A modest proportion of the variation in fibrinogen levels can be explained by genotype, inferring that variation in genomic sequences that regulate the fibrinogen genes ( FGA , FGB and FGG ) may affect hepatic fibrinogen production and perhaps CVD risk. We previously identified a conserved liver enhancer in the fibrinogen gene cluster (CNC12), between FGB and FGA . Genome-wide Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that transcription factors which bind fibrinogen gene promoters also interact with CNC12, as well as two potential fibrinogen enhancers (PFE), between FGA and FGG . Here we show that one of the PFE sequences has potent hepatocyte enhancer activity. Using a luciferase reporter gene system, we found that PFE2 enhances minimal promoter- and FGA promoter-driven gene expression in hepatoma cells, regardless of its orientation with respect to the promoters. A region within PFE2 bears a short series of conserved nucleotides which maintain enhancer activity without flanking sequence. We also demonstrate that PFE2 is a liver enhancer in vivo, driving enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in transgenic zebrafish larval livers. Our study shows that combining public domain ChIP-seq data with in vitro and in vivo functional tests can identify novel fibrinogen gene cluster regulatory sequences. Variation in such elements could affect fibrinogen production and influence CVD risk.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: African Americans (AA) historically have a low response rate to hepatitis C therapies, and there is limited information available for this patient population regarding the development and treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The aim of this study was to evaluate liver disease progression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in AA with CHC. Methods: Between 1995 and 2008, 246 AA patients with CHC were identified from a database of patients and followed until 2012-2013 (average 8 years) or the development of HCC after 2008. Results: Viral clearance (intent to treat; sustained virus response (SVR)) was achieved in 15% of patients with interferon based therapies with or without ribavirin. AA patients who achieved an SVR (n=22) did not develop HCC or new onset cirrhosis, whereas the HCC incidence in untreated AA patients was 23% (51/203). Patients who achieved an SVR also had improved fibrosis, as defined by the AST Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, relative to nonresponders and untreated patients. Conclusions: The severity of liver disease at the first visit (except for cirrhosis) correlated with the development of HCC, but because of the overlap in values between patients, these measurements were not useful for predicting individual risk. Since cirrhosis at the first visit was not a predictive factor, treatment with newer antiviral therapies is the best option for reducing the incidence of advanced liver disease and its harmful outcomes in the AA population.",

Methods: Among 691 newly diagnosed HCC patients, 287 were treated with TACE as a first therapy. We analyzed the predictive factors for CR, recurrence after CR, and overall survival (OS). Results: Eighty-one patients (28.2%) achieved CR after TACE, and recurrence after CR was detected in 35 patients (43.2%). In multivariate analyses, tumor size (≤5 cm) and single nodularity were predictive factors for CR, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.35 (p=0.002) and 0.41 (p<0.001), respectively. Elevated serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) (>20 ng/mL) level and multinodularity exhibited significant relationships with recurrence after CR, with HRs of 2.220 (p=0.026) and 3.887 (p<0.001), respectively. Tumor size (>5 cm), multinodularity, elevated serum AFP (>20 ng/mL) level, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (B and C), and portal vein thrombosis were significant factors for OS.

    "Abstract": "Background: PPAT (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amido transferase) catalyzes the first committed step of de novo purine biosynthesis and is a key regulatory point in the biosynthesis of nascent purine nucleotides. However, the clinical significance and biologic role of PPAT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. Methods: We compared the expression of PPAT in carcinomatous and precancerous hepatocellular carcinoma tissues by immunohistochemistry in 90 cases of HCC. Correlation analysis was also made on clinical data, survival, classification, and staging. Results: The expression of PPAT in HCC tumor tissues is significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. The results of the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that HCC patients with high PPAT expression survived shorter than those with low PPAT expression. Moreover, the expression of PPAT was significantly associated with the tumor grade (P=0.014), PD-L1 (P<0.001), and CTLA4 (P=0.003). The later grade of the tumor, the higher the expression of PPAT. In the PD-L1 high expression group, PPAT is also highly expressed. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that PPAT expression might be included in the process of carcinogenesis and prognosis. Hence, PPAT could be served as a new prognostic biomarker for patients of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET pathway plays a critical role in the development of the nervous system and has been implicated in medulloblastoma pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown a role for gene amplification of activators of this pathway, as well as silencing of its inhibitors in medulloblastoma pathogenesis. We analyzed exon array data from a cohort of 103 primary medulloblastomas to show that HGF/MET pathway elements are dysregulated in tumors compared to normal cerebellum. To determine if mutation of HGF/MET pathway genes is a mechanism for pathway dysregulation, we conducted a mutational analysis by exon resequencing of three key components of this pathway, including serine protease inhibitor Kunitz-type 1 (SPINT1), serine protease inhibitor Kunitz-type 2 (SPINT2), and MET, in 32 primary human medulloblastoma specimens. From this analysis, we identified multiple coding synonymous and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes among the 32 tumor samples. Interestingly, we also discovered two unreported sequence variants in SPINT1 and SPINT2 in two tumors that resulted in Arginine to Histidine amino acid substitutions at codons 418 and 233, respectively. However, conservation assessment and functional assays of these two variants indicate that they involve nonconserved residues and that they do not affect the function of SPINT1 and SPINT2 as tumor suppressor genes. In conclusion, our data suggest that mutation alone plays a minor role in causing aberrancies of the HGF/MET pathway in medulloblastoma in comparison with other malignancies such as breast, hepatocellular, renal, and lung carcinomas.",

    "Abstract": "Among genetic alterations, the activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes in affected cells are considered to be the core molecular events that provide a selective growth advantage and clonal expansion during the multistep process of carcinogenesis. The TP53 tumour suppressor gene is mutated in about half of all human cancer cases. The p53 protein modulates multiple cellular functions, such as gene transcription, DNA synthesis and repair, cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis. Mutations in the TP53 gene can abrogate these functions, leading to genetic instability and progression to cancer. The molecular archaeology of the TP53 mutation spectrum generates hypotheses concerning the etiology and molecular pathogenesis of each type of cancer. The spectrum of somatic mutations in the TP53 gene, of which 75% are missense mutations, implicates environmental carcinogens and endogenous processes in the etiology of human cancer. The presence of a characteristic TP53 mutation can also manifest a molecular link between exposure to a particular carcinogen and a specific type of human cancer, e.g. exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and codon 249 mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma; exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and C:C-->T:T tandem mutations in skin cancer; and cigarette smoking and the prevalence of G-->T transversions in lung cancer. Although exogenous carcinogens have been shown to target p53 selectively, evidence supporting the endogenous insult of TP53 from oxyradicals and nitrogen-oxyradicals is also accumulating. TP53 mutations can be a biomarker of carcinogen effect. Determining the characteristic TP53 mutation load in non-tumorous tissue, using a highly sensitive mutation assay, can indicate exposure to a specific carcinogen and may also help in identifying individuals at an increased risk of cancer.",

Purpose: The authors report a case of a malignant type of acanthosis nigricans in 42-year-old female patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. Case report: First skin lesions appeared in 2000. The patient died within 22 months (of the first appearance of skin symptoms), because of hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein we report the clinical picture, skin involvement and diagnostic procedures in acanthosis nigricans. Conclusions: Paraneoplastic type of acanthosis nigricans--in patient with hepatocellular carcinoma is not frequently reported in the literature. In the aspect of clinical occurrence of skin lesions suggesting acanthosis nigricans the diagnostics should be focused on internal malignancies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obesity are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this observational study was to examine the relationship of MetS and a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in patients without diabetes in the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN). Methods: Clinical, demographic, histological, laboratory and anthropometric data were collected on 356 adult patients without diabetes with NAFLD. Obesity was defined as body mass index ≥30.0. MetS was determined using the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) 2001 criteria to include 3 or more of the following: increased waist circumference, elevated triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension and elevated fasting blood glucose. Results: Most patients were obese (71%) and had MetS (67%). Obesity was more prevalent among patients with MetS (80% vs 52%; p≤0.001). Markers of insulin resistance such as homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (6.5 vs 4.9, p≤0.001) were higher among those with MetS compared with those without MetS. Histologically, patients without MetS had higher hepatocellular (p=0.04) and reticuloendothelial system iron (p=0.04). Patients with MetS were more likely to have severe hepatic steatosis (p=0.04) and chronic portal inflammation (p=0.01). On multiple logistic regression analysis, patients with definite NASH were almost 2.5 times more likely to have MetS than those without definite NASH (OR=2.41, p=0.01). Conclusions: MetS is common in patients without diabetes with NAFLD and is associated with greater insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and portal inflammation. While patients without MetS have greater iron overload, patients with MetS may have an increased propensity to have NASH. Therefore, presence of MetS in patients without diabetes with NAFLD may serve as a potential criterion for liver biopsy. Trial registration number: NCT00063622; Pre-results.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we present evidence that ginsenoside-Rs4 (G-Rs4; an acetylated analogue of ginsenoside-Rg5), a new ginseng saponin isolated from Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, elevates protein levels of p53 and p21WAF1, which are associated with the induction of apoptosis in SK-HEP-1 cells. Flow cytometric analyses showed that G-Rs4 initially arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary, but consequently induced apoptosis as evidenced by generating an apoptotic peak. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed by the results of DNA fragmentation assays and alterations in cell morphology after treatment of the cells with G-Rs4. Immunoblot assays showed that G-Rs4 significantly elevated protein levels of p53 and p21WAF1, concurrently with the downregulation of both cyclins E- and A-dependent kinase activities and induction of apoptosis. We suggest that G-Rs4 induces apoptosis, the effect of which is closely related to the downregulation of both cyclins E- and A-dependent kinase activity as a consequence of selectively elevating protein levels of p53 and p21WAF1 in SK-HEP-1 cells.",

    "Abstract": "Hepcidin negatively regulates systemic iron homeostasis in response to inflammation and elevated serum iron. Conversely, hepcidin expression is diminished in response to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and increased erythropoietic demand, though the molecular intermediates involved are incompletely understood. To address this, we have investigated hypoxic hepcidin regulation in HuH7 hepatoma cells either cultured alone or cocultured with activated THP-1 macrophages. HuH7 hepcidin mRNA expression was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Hepcidin promoter activity was measured using luciferase reporter constructs containing a 0.9 kb fragment of the wild-type human hepcidin promoter, and constructs containing mutations in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD4, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and E-box-responsive elements. Hepatic expression of bone morphogenetic proteins BMP2 and BMP6 and the BMP inhibitor noggin was determined using Q-PCR, and the protein expression of hemojuvelin (HJV), pSMAD 1/5/8, and SMAD4 was determined by western blotting. Following exposure to hypoxia or H(2)O(2), hepcidin mRNA expression and promoter activity increased in HuH7 cells monocultures but were decreased in HuH7 cells cocultured with THP-1 macrophages. This repression was attenuated by mutation of the BMP/SMAD4-response element, suggesting that modulation of SMAD signaling mediated the response to hypoxia. No changes in hepatocyte BMP2, BMP6 or noggin mRNA, or protein expression of HJV or pSMAD 1/5/8 were detected. However, treatment with hypoxia caused a marked decrease in nuclear and cytosolic SMAD4 protein and SMAD4 mRNA expression in cocultured HuH7 cells. Together these data indicate that hypoxia represses hepcidin expression through inhibition of BMP/SMAD signaling.",

Although outcome data for the ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by IRE are limited, early results are encouraging and may suggest equivalency to the outcomes achieved by thermal ablation methods such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). However, IRE can be a challenging and very time-consuming procedure compared to RFA and MWA. In this review article, we not only evaluate the efficacy and safety of IRE for the treatment of HCC, but also discuss imaging guidance, ablation monitoring, and endpoint assessment, with a particular focus on ultrasonography.",

    "Abstract": "Aim of the study: To better understanding the contribution of coagulation factors to the extent of adenovirus-mediated innate toxicity on the hepatocyte. Material and methods: Adenovirus-36 (AD) and adenovector type 5-GFP (Ad5-GFP) were propagated and titered; then, they were loaded with coagulation factors VII or X. The complex of adenovirus with coagulation factor VII and X were for size and charge parameters. After adding AD-VII and AD-X complexes, the expression levels of innate inflammatory genes including protein kinase R (PKR), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8 and IL-18 were measured by Real-time PCR on a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2. Results: The loading of coagulation factors VII and X on Ad5-GFP enhanced the transduction rate up to 50% and 60% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared to the adenovector alone (30%) (p < 0.05). The formation of the coagulation factor-virus complex leads to multimodal size distribution with an increase in average hydrodynamic size and absolute zeta potential. The qPCR results showed that PKR expression increased significantly after treatment with all adenoviruses. These findings also showed that AD had a significant (p = 0.0152) inflammatory impact on Hep-G2. However, AD which was loaded with FX (AD-X) exhibited the most inflammatory effect (p = 0.0164). Significantly, the expression of IL-1β (p = 0.0041), IL-8 (p = 0.0107) and IL-18 (p = 0.0193) were also enhanced following FX loading. On the other hand, the AD-VII complex showed the least effect of innate immune induction when compared to the negative control (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The loading of coagulation factors, particularly FX, could enhance the transduction efficiency of Ad5-GFP. Furthermore, adenovirus loaded with FX exhibited more innate toxicity on the hepatocytes, while it was not the case for FVII.",

    "Abstract": "Approximately 2 million Japanese individuals are infected with hepatitis C virus and are at risk for cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients in whom interferon (IFN)/ribavirin (RBV) therapy has failed remain at risk as effective therapeutic options are limited. This phase 2, randomized, open-label study evaluated an IFN- and RBV-free regimen of once-daily ombitasvir (ABT-267), an NS5A inhibitor, plus paritaprevir (ABT-450), an NS3/4A protease inhibitor dosed with ritonavir (paritaprevir/ritonavir), in pegylated IFN/RBV treatment-experienced Japanese patients with hepatitis C virus subtype 1b or genotype 2 infection. Patients without cirrhosis (aged 18-75 years) with subtype 1b infection received ombitasvir 25 mg plus paritaprevir/ritonavir 100/100 mg or 150/100 mg for 12 or 24 weeks; patients with genotype 2 infection received ombitasvir 25 mg plus paritaprevir/ritonavir 100/100 mg or 150/100 mg for 12 weeks. Sustained virologic response (SVR) at posttreatment week 24 (SVR24 ) was the primary endpoint. Adverse events were collected throughout the study. One hundred ten patients received ≥1 dose of study medication. In the subtype 1b cohort, SVR24 rates were high (88.9%-100%) regardless of paritaprevir dose or treatment duration. In the genotype 2 cohort, SVR24 rates were 57.9% and 72.2% with 100 mg and 150 mg of paritaprevir, respectively. The SVR24 rate was higher in patients with subtype 2a (90%) than 2b (27%). Concordance between SVR12 and SVR24 was 100%. The most common adverse events overall were nasopharyngitis (29%) and headache (14%). Conclusion: In this difficult-to-treat population of patients in whom prior pegylated IFN/RBV had failed, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir demonstrated potent antiviral activity with a favorable safety profile among Japanese patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1b or 2a infection.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatoblastoma (HB) and pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the most common malignant liver tumors in childhood. Both tumor types exhibit genetic and epigenetic alterations in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is a key regulator of liver progenitor cells in embryonic development. The tumors demonstrate a high rate of β-catenin mutations and gene expression changes of several WNT antagonists. However, the role of the WNT inhibitory factor secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) has not been addressed in pediatric liver cancer so far. Results: In our study, we investigated the gene expression level, DNA methylation status and functional relevance of SFRP1 in HB cell lines and in pediatric liver tumor patient samples. SFRP1 was downregulated due to DNA promoter methylation in all tested HB cell lines. Overexpression of SFRP1 in HB cell lines diminished tumor cell proliferation, colony formation and migration potential. In addition, the SFRP1-expressing HB cell lines showed reduced WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway activity and decreased expression of WNT target genes. To evaluate the utility of SFRP1 as a biomarker in pediatric liver cancer, we determined the gene expression level and DNA methylation status of SFRP1 in 45 pediatric liver tumor patient samples. The correlation analysis of different clinical parameters and tumor characteristics revealed a significant correlation of reduced SFRP1 expression with the presence of mutant β-catenin. The methylation status of SFRP1 was furthermore associated to a pediatric liver tumor type with HCC-like characteristics, TERT mutations and an older age at diagnosis. Conclusion: Altogether, our data demonstrate that the epigenetic suppression of the WNT/β-catenin antagonist SFRP1 has an important impact on the malignant behavior of HB cells. Although SFRP1 methylation is a common event in HCC-like pediatric liver tumors, its potential as a prognostic or diagnostic biomarker needs to be further investigated.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatoblastoma (HB) is a rare tumor, but it is the most common primary liver malignancy in children and comprised of approximately 1% of all pediatric malignancies. Mostly, this tumor is sporadic in nature but can show a syndrome association. Upregulation in Wnt/β-catenin pathway can be there in 70-80% cases of HB. Most often present as abdominal mass and has a raised alpha-fetoprotein levels. Distant metastasis usually occurs in the lungs. HB is classified into 2 broad categories: epithelial and mesenchymal type. The majority of HB are epithelial type. The HB must be distinguished from focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, while small-cell undifferentiated HB from the malignant rhabdoid tumor. The histomorphology and immunohistochemistry are essential for the diagnosis of different HB. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery is the mainstay of the treatment. The 2 well-established prognostic factors of HB are stage and histological type. Herein, we report a case series of common and rare histological variants of HB.",

    "Abstract": "Background: There is ample evidence that macrophages play a crucial role in the biological processes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was designed to establish a novel macrophage-associated prognostic model for HCC. Methods: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) microarrays and clinical data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analysed using a univariate Cox proportional regression model to select macrophage-associated prognostic lncRNAs. Multivariate Cox proportional regression models and survival analysis were used to establish a prognosis index (PI) model. Furthermore, to better understand the biological functions of differentially expressed macrophage-associated lncRNAs (MALs) in HCC, enrichment analysis was performed. Finally, the correlation between MALs and clinical features was further analysed in HCC. Results: We identified eight MALs with significant prognostic values for HCC. Next, a PI model for HCC was developed, and patients were classified into the high-risk or low-risk group based on risk scores. The overall survival (OS) of high-risk patients was significantly shorter than that of low-risk patients (P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate factors indicate that risk scores can be used as independent prognostic factors for patients with HCC. Multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots show that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the risk score is higher than that of other clinical features. The C-index of our nomogram was 0.768. Conclusion: The PI model has a prognostic efficacy superior to that of other clinical features.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: To evaluate the outcome following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and to identify the predictors of survival in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Material and methods: HCC patients reporting to our hospital (2001-2007) were subjected to clinical, biochemical, and radiological examination. TACE was performed in those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Follow-up assessment was done with multiphase CT scan of the liver at 1, 3, and 6 months. Tumor response and survival rate were estimated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done for determinants of survival. Results: A total of 73 patients (69 males, 4 females; mean age 49±13.4 years) were subjected to 123 sessions of TACE. The Child's classification was: A - 56 patients and B - 17 patients. Barcelona Clinic staging was: A - 20 patients, B - 38 patients, and C - 15 patients. Tumor size was ≤5cm in 28 (38%) patients, >5-10 cm in 28 (38%) patients, and >10 cm in 17 (23%) patients. Median follow-up was for 12 months (range: 1-77 months). No significant postprocedure complications were encountered. Overall survival rate was 66%, 47%, and 36.4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Tumor size emerged as an important predictor of survival. Conclusion: TACE offers a reasonable palliative therapy for HCC. Initial tumor size is an independent predictor of survival.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Response to preoperative transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been recommended as a biological selection criterion for liver transplantation (LT). The aim of our study was to identify optimal timing of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) after TACE based on the TACE response. Methods: We performed a retrospective study to assess recurrence in 128 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who underwent LDLT following sequential TACE from January 2002 to March 2015 at a single institute. Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were utilized to estimate HCC recurrence and find optimal timing for LDLT. Results: Seventy-three and 61 patients were divided as the responder and nonresponder, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed independent pre-liver transplantation (pre-LT) predictors of recurrence were larger sized tumor (>3 cm, P = 0.024), nonresponse to TACE (P = 0.031), vascular invasion (P = 0.002), and extrahepatic nodal involvement (P = 0.001). In the 3-month time difference between last pre-LT TACE and LDLT subgroup, TACE responders showed significantly higher adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of recurrence free survival (aHR, 6.284; P = 0.007), cancer specific survival (aHR, 7.033; P = 0.016), and overall survival (aHR, 7.055; P = 0.005). Moreover, for overall patients and responder groups, the significant time difference between last pre-LT TACE and LDLT was 2 months in the minimum P-value approach. Conclusion: In selected patients who showed good response to pre-LT TACE, a shorter time interval between TACE and LDLT may be associated with higher recurrence free survival, cancer specific survival, and overall survival.",

    "Abstract": "Freezing is recognized as the most effective method of maintaining a stable supply of various cell types for long-term storage. However, cells might be damaged by environmental changes during the freezing process. There are various factors that influence the function of cells cultured after cryopreservation and thawing. These factors include cryopreservation solutions, biomaterials, freezing methods, and the freezing and preservation temperatures. There is also a risk of infection with mycoplasma in liquid nitrogen phase. Therefore, it is necessary to consider more useful and safe methods for freezing and storing various cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature during long-term storage (8 years at -80 °C and in liquid nitrogen phase) on the quality of various cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, bovine carotid artery normal endothelial cells, mouse fibroblast cells 3T3, and mouse embryo fibroblast cells STO). We examined the cell viability of cryopreserved human hepatocellular carcinoma cells at -80 °C using culture medium containing 10% DMSO, Cell Banker 1, and Cell Banker 2 as cryopreservation solutions. Among these solutions, Cell Banker 1 showed the highest efficiency. The viability of human hepatocellular carcinoma and bovine carotid artery normal endothelial cells in the Cell Banker 1 stored at -80 °C was over 90%, which was the same as that in liquid nitrogen phase. The cells stored at -80 °C had a morphology similar to that of the cells stored at liquid nitrogen phase. The proliferation of cells stored at -80 °C and in liquid nitrogen phase was not significantly different. Furthermore, none of the cells were infected with mycoplasma. There was no marked difference in the albumin secretion between the human hepatocellular carcinoma cells stored at -80 °C and those in liquid nitrogen phase. The short tandem repeats of the human hepatocellular carcinoma cells stored at -80 °C were identical to those stored in liquid nitrogen phase. In this report, various cells stored long-term at -80 °C were able to be used effectively after long-term storage. These findings can be applied to drug discovery, cell medicine, and cell therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: Recent advances in hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic testing methods allow for a one-stop simplified 'test and cure' approach. The cost effectiveness of incorporating this simplified approach into HCV screening in Iraq remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the cost effectiveness of different HCV testing and diagnostic approaches, and screening strategies in Iraq from a health service perspective. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using a hybrid model comprising a screening decision tree linked to a lifetime Markov model to estimate outcomes in HCV-infected people. Cost and utility estimates were sourced from the published literature and expert guidance provided by clinicians and policy makers in Iraq. Cost estimates were reported in 2019 USD or 2019 Iraqi Dinar and both costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. Results: Strategies using a simplified approach were found to be cost saving in addition to improving patient outcomes when compared with a standard testing and diagnostic approach. When considering risk-based screening, a simplified approach was associated with a total cost saving of Iraqi Dinar 4375 billion (USD 3.7 billion) and per patient life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gains of 0.30 and 0.55, compared with a standard approach. Benefits and cost savings were driven by a 32.2% and 23.6% reduction in the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Estimated benefits and cost savings increased under total population screening. All screening and testing and diagnostic approaches were cost effective compared with a no screening scenario. Conclusions: Improvements in the detection of HCV combined with a simplified one-stop testing and diagnostic approach represents an opportunity to reduce the burden of HCV in Iraq and may play a significant role in meeting World Health Organisation HCV elimination targets.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Molecular genetic markers to identify the 13% lymph node-negative mammary carcinomas that are prone to develop metastases would clearly be of considerable value in indicating those cases in need of early aggressive therapy. Methods: Representational difference analysis was used in an attempt to identify genetic alterations related to breast cancer metastasis by comparing genomic DNA from microdissected normal cells and from metastatic cells of ductal breast carcinoma patients. Results: Representational difference analysis products yielded 10 unique metastasis-associated DNA sequences (MADS), i.e. products apparently lost in metastatic cell DNA. Of these sequences, MADS-IX was found to be lost in the transition from primary to metastasis in two out of five ductal breast carcinoma cases. This sequence was localized on chromosome 10q21 by radiation hybrid mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The PTEN gene, which is also located on chromosome 10q, was detected to be present by PCR in all five cases. On the contrary, a breast carcinoma cell line, HCC-1937, which has homozygous loss of a region encompassing the PTEN gene, showed the presence of MADS-IX. PCR screening of three additional breast carcinoma cell lines with known losses in specific chromosomal regions also showed the presence of MADS-IX. Conclusion: These data suggest that MADS-IX possibly is part of a novel candidate metastasis-associated gene located close to the PTEN gene on chromosome 10q. The first set of PCR screening in five patient samples indicates that it could be used as a molecular marker for ductal mammary metastasis.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To provide a systematic overview of the effects of various parameters on contrast enhancement within the same population, an animal experiment as well as a computer-aided simulation study was performed. Materials and methods: In an animal experiment, single-level dynamic CT through the liver was performed at 5-second intervals just after the injection of contrast medium for 3 minutes. Combinations of three different amounts (1, 2, 3 mL/kg), concentrations (150, 200, 300 mgI/mL), and injection rates (0.5, 1, 2 mL/sec) were used. The CT number of the aorta (A), portal vein (P) and liver (L) was measured in each image, and time-attenuation curves for A, P and L were thus obtained. The degree of maximum enhancement (Imax) and time to reach peak enhancement (Tmax) of A, P and L were determined, and times to equilibrium (Teq) were analyzed. In the computed-aided simulation model, a program based on the amount, flow, and diffusion coefficient of body fluid in various compartments of the human body was designed. The input variables were the concentrations, volumes and injection rates of the contrast media used. The program generated the time-attenuation curves of A, P and L, as well as liver-to-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) contrast curves. On each curve, we calculated and plotted the optimal temporal window (time period above the lower threshold, which in this experiment was 10 Hounsfield units), the total area under the curve above the lower threshold, and the area within the optimal range. Results: A. Animal Experiment: At a given concentration and injection rate, an increased volume of contrast medium led to increases in Imax A, P and L. In addition, Tmax A, P, L and Teq were prolonged in parallel with increases in injection time The time-attenuation curve shifted upward and to the right. For a given volume and injection rate, an increased concentration of contrast medium increased the degree of aortic, portal and hepatic enhancement, though Tmax A, P and L remained the same. The time-attenuation curve shifted upward. For a given volume and concentration of contrast medium, changes in the injection rate had a prominent effect on aortic enhancement, and that of the portal vein and hepatic parenchyma also showed some increase, though the effect was less prominent. A increased in the rate of contrast injection led to shifting of the time enhancement curve to the left and upward. B. Computer Simulation: At a faster injection rate, there was minimal change in the degree of hepatic attenuation, though the duration of the optimal temporal window decreased. The area between 10 and 30 HU was greatest when contrast media was delivered at a rate of 2-3 mL/sec. Although the total area under the curve increased in proportion to the injection rate, most of this increase was above the upper threshold and thus the temporal window was narrow and the optimal area decreased. Conclusion: Increases in volume, concentration and injection rate all resulted in improved arterial enhancement. If cost was disregarded, increasing the injection volume was the most reliable way of obtaining good quality enhancement. The optimal way of delivering a given amount of contrast medium can be calculated using a computer-based mathematical model.",

    "Abstract": "We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of antisense therapy for splicing defects in cellular models of metabolic diseases, suppressing the use of cryptic splice sites or pseudoexon insertions. To date, no animal models with these defects are available. Here, we propose exon skipping of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (Pah) gene expressed in liver and kidney to generate systemic hyperphenylalaninemia in mice as a sensitive in vivo assay to test splice suppression. Systemic elevation of blood L-Phe can be quantified using tandem MS/MS. Exon 11 and/or 12 skipping for the normal PAH gene was validated in hepatoma cells for comparing two oligonucleotide chemistries, morpholinos and locked nucleic acids. Subsequently, Vivo-morpholinos (VMO) were tested in wild-type and in phenotypically normal Pah(enu2/+) heterozygous mice to target exon 11 and/or 12 of the murine Pah gene using different VMO dosing, mode of injection and treatment regimes. Consecutive intravenous injections of VMO resulted in transient hyperphenylalaninemia correlating with complete exon skipping and absence of PAH protein and enzyme activity. Sustained effect required repeated injection of VMOs. Our results provide not only a sensitive in vivo assay to test for splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotides, but also a simple method to generate murine models for genetic liver diseases.",

    "Abstract": "A 28-year-old man presented with osteosarcoma of the occipital bone 16 years after 24 Gy of craniospinal irradiation for acute lymphocytic leukemia. The tumor had both intra- and extra-cranial components. However, the affected skull appeared to be normal on imaging because of permeative infiltration by the tumor. Subtotal resection was achieved and the tumor was verified histologically as an osteosarcoma. The residual tumor soon showed remarkable enlargement and disseminated to the spinal cord. Both of the enlarged and disseminated tumor masses were treated by surgical intervention and chemotherapy. However, the patient deteriorated due to the tumor regrowth and died 11 months after the initial diagnosis. This patient had previously developed a leukemia, a colon cancer, a rectal cancer and a hepatocellular carcinoma. His brother also died of leukemia. The patient had a heterozygous TP53 germ-line mutation of codon 248 in the exon 7. In conclusion, we consider the present tumor to be a rare example of radiation-induced skull osteosarcoma in a member of the cancer-prone family with TP53 germ-line mutation which is associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.",

Concomitantly we documented a significative and progressive increase of serum Erythropoietin (Epo) and a small focus of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) never diagnosed before. Even in absence of immunohistochemical and/or biomolecular evidence of Epo production in the neoplastic tissue we think the hypothesis of the paraneoplastic syndrome may be the most likely both for the strict temporal relationship between the observation of the neoplastic lesion and the appearance of polycythemia and for the absence of all other known causes of erythrocytosis. Objection to this hypothesis: 1) ectopic production of Epo during HCC has been usually described in large neoplastic lesions 2) liver cirrhosis by itself may be accompanied by increased Epo levels 3) an intratumoral hypoxia with compensatory production of Epo may have occurred 4) generalized vasculopathy could have determined renal hypoxia with greater local production of Epo.",

    "Abstract": "Erythrocytosis is a common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Although increased erythropoietin (EPO) is found in these patients, the clinical significance and molecular mechanisms underlying this observation are unclear. We demonstrate an inverse relationship between EPO production and overall prognosis in our cohort of 664 patients as well as in data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In the subset of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with erythrocytosis, we identified somatic mutations of mitochondrial DNA, resulting in impairment of respiratory metabolism, which sequentially led to depletion of α-ketoglutarate, stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor-α, and expression of target genes such as EPO. Cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models were used to demonstrate that EPO promoted cancer stem cell self-renewal and expansion in an autocrine/paracrine manner through enhanced Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, to explore the therapeutic targeting of EPO-induced tumor changes, we found that blocking EPO signaling with soluble EPO receptor extracellular domain Fc fusion protein could inhibit tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: These findings suggest clinical and therapeutic implications for erythrocytosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. There is an underlying link between mitochondrial function and hypoxia inducible factor alpha signaling, revealing a mechanism of erythrocytosis in a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma patients who may benefit from treatment involving EPO signaling interference.

    "Abstract": "Tamoxifen (TAM) is a triphenylethylene antiestrogen used for the treatment, and in clinical trials for the prevention, of breast cancer in women. In rats, TAM is a strong liver carcinogen which induces the formation of liver DNA adducts. The DNA of 24 hepatocarcinomas (HCCs) collected at necropsy from individual female Sprague-Dawley rats that were given 22.6 mg/kg TAM daily for 12 months was studied for the presence of mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis. The sequences of introns 5-8 of the rat p53 gene were determined in order to design primers homologous to regions located in these introns. p53 mutations were found in 50% (12 of 24) of the HCCs. These mutations were all specifically clustered in two sites, codons 231 (exon 6-7) and 294 (exon 8). Nine HCCs contained a transition from adenine to guanine in the second base of codon 231 (CAC to CGC), which resulted in a histidine to arginine amino acid substitution; 4 HCCs contained a nonmiscoding transition from cytosine to thymidine in the third base of codon 294 (TGC to TGT; cysteine to cysteine). One HCC contained both mutations. The present report supports previous observations on the genotoxicity of TAM in rodents and raises concerns about its use as a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer in women.",

    "Abstract": "Alpha-1-microglobulin and bikunin are two plasma glycoproteins encoded by an alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP) gene. The strict liver-specific expression of the AMBP gene is controlled by a potent enhancer made of six clustered boxes numbered 1-6 that have been reported to be proven or potential binding sites for the hepatocyte-enriched nuclear factors HNF-1, -4, -3, -1, -3, -4, respectively. In the present study, electromobility shift assays of wild-type or mutated probes demonstrated that the boxes 1-5 have a binding capacity for their cognate HNF protein. Box 5 is also a target for another, as yet unidentified, factor. A functional analysis of the wild-type or mutated enhancer, driving its homologous promoter and a reporter CAT gene in the HepG2 hepatoma cell line, demonstrated that all six boxes participate in the enhancer activity, with the primary influence of box 4 (HNF-1) and box 2 (HNF-4). A similar analysis in the HNF-free CHO cell line co-transfected with one or several HNF factors further demonstrated various interplays between boxes: box 3 (HNF-3 alpha and beta) has a negative influence over the major HNF-4 box 2 as well as a positive influence over the major HNF-1 box 4.",

    "Abstract": "We previously reported that the transcription of the human macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) gene was positively regulated by the binding of NF-Y to the CAATT sequence in the promoter region of this gene. Here we confirmed our previous results and further characterized the MSP promoter. Luciferase assay with deletion constructs showed the importance of the region, +32 to +39, for the promoter activity in Hep3B cells. Two nuclear protein-DNA probe (+15 to +40) complexes, C1 and C2, were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. C2 was specific to hepatoma cells and contained hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4). DNase I footprinting with recombinant HNF-4 located another HNF-4-binding site in the distal region, -89 to -54. Mutations in the CAATT or the proximal HNF-4-binding site significantly reduced the promoter activity in Hep3B cells and HNF-4-transfected HeLa cells, whereas mutations in the distal HNF-4-binding site had no effect. The close proximity between the CAATT and the proximal HNF-4-binding site suggested that a direct contact between NF-Y and HNF-4 might be important. Protein-protein interaction between the A-subunit of NF-Y and HNF-4 was detected by a yeast two-hybrid system. The binding of in vitro translated HNF-4 to immobilized NF-YA and in vitro translated NF-YA to immobilized HNF-4 was also detected. These results suggest the binding of HNF-4 to the proximal HNF-4-binding site directs the basal transcription of the MSP gene, and the maximal promoter activity may depend on the direct association between HNF-4 and NF-Y.",

    "Abstract": "alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), a protein highly induced during fetal liver development, is down-regulated by retinoids in the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B, in contrast to up-regulation observed in other cell types. Previously, we have documented that such up-regulation involves direct effects through cis-retinoid X receptor-binding sites in the AFP enhancer. In this report, we show a distinctive effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in Hep3B cells. RA caused a marked decrease in AFP transcripts. Deletion analysis of the upstream regulatory region of the AFP gene revealed that cis-acting sites required for down-regulation resided near the promoter. Gel mobility shift assays for factors binding to key elements in the AFP promoter region demonstrated that hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1 binding was diminished in nuclear extracts from RA-treated cells. In addition, HNF4, which is not known to bind to the AFP promoter but does regulate HNF1, was also diminished. The levels of HNF1 and HNF4 mRNA were also decreased following RA treatment. AFP promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transient transfection assays demonstrated that the level of HNF1 had a direct impact on basal transcription as well as RA-mediated down-regulation of the AFP gene, and that co-transfection of HNF1 and HNF4, but not transfection of either factor alone, reversed the RA-mediated inhibition. Taken together these data point to an interaction among the RA, HNF1, and HNF4 signals, which is reflected in decreased expression of AFP.",

    "Abstract": "To study the transcriptional regulation of the liver gluconeogenic phenotype, the underdifferentiated mouse Hepa-1c1c7 (Hepa) hepatoma cell line was used. These cells mimicked the fetal liver by appreciably expressing the alpha-fetoprotein and albumin genes but not the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene. Unlike the fetal liver, however, Hepa cells failed to express the early-expressed factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) and HNF-4 and the late-expressed factor C/EBP alpha, thereby providing a suitable system for examining possible cooperation between these factors in the transcriptional regulation of the PEPCK gene. Transient transfection assays of a chimeric PEPCK-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct showed a residual PEPCK promoter activity in the Hepa cell line, which was slightly stimulated by cotransfection with a single transcription factor from either the C/EBP family or HNF-1 alpha but not at all affected by cotransfection of HNF-4. In contrast, cotransfection of the PEPCK construct with members from the C/EBP family plus HNF-1 alpha resulted in a synergistic stimulation of the PEPCK promoter activity. This synergistic effect depended on the presence in the PEPCK promoter region of the HNF-1 recognition sequence and on the presence of two C/EBP recognition sequences. The results demonstrate a requirement for coexistence and cooperation between early and late liver-enriched transcription factors in the transcriptional regulation of the PEPCK gene. In addition, the results suggest redundancy between members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors in the regulation of PEPCK gene expression.",

    "Abstract": "Factor B (Bf) is a constituent of the alternative pathway of complement activation encoded within the major histocompatibility complex. Transcription of the murine gene from two initiation sites generates two Bf mRNA species differing in size and tissue distribution. Striking genetic, tissue-specific differences in Bf mRNA levels at extrahepatic sites (kidney and intestine) among mouse strains correlate with a DNA sequence polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the gene and differential nuclear protein binding at the Bf upstream transcriptional initiation site (UIS). To ascertain the functional consequences of this polymorphism in the Bf promoter, we analyzed the effects of strain-specific sequences in the Bf 5' region on the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene transfected in human and mouse hepatoma cells. The CAT activity and mRNA level produced when transcription was driven by the sequence of strains with high extrahepatic expression were reduced to background levels when the sequence specific to the low expressor strains was used. Eighty percent of this difference was accounted for by a point substitution that affects DNA-protein interaction at the UIS, the sequence of higher affinity conferring higher expression. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4), derived from HepG2, mouse liver and kidney or cell-free translation of HNF-4 RNA, is the nuclear protein that preferentially binds to the high expressor UIS. Bf-CAT is not expressed in cells that lack HNF-4 (CV-1). However, co-transfection of HNF-4 into CV-1 cells drives Bf-CAT expression and reproduces the differences derived from the substitution that affect HNF-4 binding in vitro. These data show that interaction of HNF-4 with polymorphic variants of the upstream Bf promoter is the major determinant of strain-specific extrahepatic factor B expression.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) is a liver-enriched transcription factor and a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. HNF-4 is required for the hepatoma-specific expression of HNF-1 alpha, another liver-enriched transcription factor, suggesting the early participation of HNF-4 in development. To prepare for further study of HNF-4 in development, the tissue-specific expression of the mouse HNF-4 gene was studied by analyzing the promoter region for required DNA elements. DNase-hypersensitive sites in the gene in liver and kidney tissues were found in regions both distal and proximal to the RNA start that were absent in tissues in which HNF-4 expression did not occur. By use of reporter constructs in transient-transfection assays and with transgenic mice, a region sufficient to drive liver-specific expression of HNF-4 was identified. While an HNF-1 binding site between bp -98 and -68 played an important role in the hepatoma-specific promoter activity of HNF-4 in transient-transfection assays, it was not sufficient for the liver-specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice. Distal enhancer elements indicated by the presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites at kb -5.5 and -6.5, while not functional in transient-transfection assays, were required for the correct expression of the mouse HNF-4 gene in animals.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Giant cell hepatitis in the adult population remains very poorly defined with only 100 case reports published in the literature over the last three decades. Aim: To present our center's experience in an attempt to learn about the predisposing factors, outcomes and efficacy of proposed therapeutic interventions for giant cell hepatitis. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted through the electronic records of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. We queried 36726 liver biopsy reports from January 1, 1991 to December 6, 2016. Our search yielded 50 patients who were identified as carrying a definite diagnosis of post-infantile giant cell hepatitis (PIGCH) by pathology. The data collected included demographic information, laboratory data (liver function tests, autoimmune markers) and transplant status. In order to better analyze patient characteristics and outcomes, subjects were separated into a non-transplant (native) liver group and a post-liver transplant (allograft) group. Results: The incidence of PIGCH was approximately 0.14% of all biopsies queried in the 25-year period. The mean age was 48 years with 66% females. Liver function tests were classified as 38.2% cholestatic, 35.3% hepatocellular and 26.5% mixed. Autoimmune hepatitis was found to be the most prevalent predisposing factor leading to PIGCH constituting 32% of cases. Management consisted mainly of immunosuppression, viral targeted therapy, supportive care and in six cases liver transplantations. Conclusion: The diagnosis of PIGCH remains clinically challenging and requires a high index of suspicion as well as a thorough history, physical examination, serological workup and liver biopsy. Treatment of the underlying cause can result in clinical stability in a large number of cases.",

    "Abstract": "Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling caused by mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or beta-catenin is a critical event in the development of human colorectal tumors. Wnt signaling stabilizes beta-catenin, which in turn associates with TCF/LEF family transcription factors, ultimately altering the expression of Wnt target genes. We have recently identified ICAT, a beta-catenin-interacting protein that interferes with the interaction between beta-catenin and TCF-4, thereby negatively regulating Wnt signaling. In the present study, we generated a recombinant adenovirus encoding ICAT and examined its effect on the growth of tumor cells. We found that Icat inhibits proliferation of colorectal tumor cells mutated in APC or beta-catenin and hepatocellular carcinoma cells mutated in AXIN: By contrast, Icat did not inhibit growth of either normal or tumor cells containing the wild-type APC, beta-catenin, and Axin genes. Icat also inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of colorectal tumor cells and tumorigenic growth of colorectal tumor xenografts. Furthermore, we found that Icat inhibits both dephosphorylation of Cdc2 and nuclear translocation of cyclin B1 and induces G(2) arrest followed by cell death in colorectal tumor cells. These results suggest that Wnt signaling is critical for the growth of colorectal tumors and some hepatocellular carcinomas and that expression of ICAT or drugs which mimic its effects may be useful in the treatment of these tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatic adenomas are strongly linked to excess hormonal exposure, but little else is known about their pathogenesis. The Wnt signaling pathway, which is activated in both hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatoblastomas, has not been studied in hepatic adenomas. Fifteen hepatic adenomas were studied by immunohistochemistry for estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors (ER, PR, AR, respectively) and correlated with the results of immunostaining for beta-catenin. Direct sequencing was performed to look for mutations in key genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway: Exon 3 of beta-catenin encompassing the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylation region and the mutational cluster region of the adenomatosis polyposis coli protein (APC). Analysis for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 5q was also performed. Immunostaining for both ER and PR was present in 11/15 (73%) adenomas, and staining with one hormone receptor was positively associated with staining for the other receptor. AR positivity was present in 3/15 cases. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was present in 7/15 (46%) of adenomas, indicating activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. However, no beta-catenin mutations, no APC mutations in the mutational cluster region, and no 5q LOH were detected. Two APC polymorphisms of unknown significance were seen. No clear association between beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and hormone receptor positivity was discerned. Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway appears to be important in a subset of hepatic adenomas but does not result from common beta-catenin or APC mutations and does not appear to be directly linked to hormonal receptor status.",

    "Abstract": "To understand the nature and roles of mutated beta-catenin in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 57 cases of surgically resected HCCs were studied. DNAs extracted from each tumor were examined for somatic mutations of exon 3, and the protein expressions of beta-catenin, cyclin D1, and Ki-67 were observed by immunohistochemical staining. beta-catenin mutations in exon 3 were detected in 10 (17.5%) out of 57 HCCs, including nine missense mutations and one deletion mutation. All of the cases with gene alterations had the anti-HCV antibody, and tested negative for the HBs antigen in the sera. All of the mutations occurred at the serine/threonine phosphorylation sites of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) or their neighboring residues. Significant correlation with intracellular expression (p=0.00055) was shown in the HCCs harboring beta-catenin mutations. The intracellular accumulation of beta-catenin showed significant correlation with the cyclin D1 expression (p=0.00858), and with a higher proliferation index (p=0.00072). In addition, the beta-catenin mutations showed significant association with the cyclin D1 expression (p=0.0424). These results suggest that accumulated beta-catenin proteins may bind to the lymphocyte enhancer binding factor-1 (LEF-1), form the beta-catenin/LEF-1 complex, and stimulate such promoters regulating the cell cycle as the cyclin D1 gene. This is the first report to demonstrate a significant correlation between beta-catenin and the cyclin D1 expression in human HCCs.",

We have generated transgenic mice expressing an oncogenic form of beta-catenin in their hepatocytes to analyze the effect of deregulated beta-catenin signaling on liver homeostasis. These mice rapidly developed hepatomegaly soon after birth, with livers three to four times heavier than those of nontransgenic littermates. The liver cell hyperplasia resulted from increased cell proliferation without any compensatory apoptosis. Although the genes encoding c-myc and cyclin D1 are potential targets of the beta-catenin signaling pathway, neither of them was overexpressed in the hyperplastic livers of beta-catenin transgenic mice. Thus, the key target genes of the beta-catenin signaling pathway in the liver remain to be identified.",

    "Abstract": "Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a form of radiotherapy that delivers high doses of irradiation with high precision in a small number of fractions. However, it has not frequently been performed for the liver due to the risk of radiation-induced liver toxicity. Furthermore, liver SBRT is cumbersome because it requires accurate patient repositioning, target localization, control of breathing-related motion, and confers a toxicity risk to the small bowel. Recently, with the advancement of modern technologies including intensity-modulated RT and image-guided RT, SBRT has been shown to significantly improve local control and survival outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), specifically those unfit for other local therapies. While it can be used as a stand-alone treatment for those patients, it can also be applied either as an alternative or as an adjunct to other HCC therapies (e.g., transarterial chemoembolization, and radiofrequency ablation). SBRT might be an effective and safe bridging therapy for patients awaiting liver transplantation. Furthermore, in recent studies, SBRT has been shown to have a potential role as an immunostimulator, supporting the novel combination strategy of immunoradiotherapy for HCC. In this review, the role of SBRT with some technical issues is discussed. In addition, future implications of SBRT as an immunostimulator are considered.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is a clinical option for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating EGFR mutations or for cancer with wild-type (WT) EGFR when chemotherapy has failed. MET receptor activation or MET gene amplification was reported to be a major mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy in NSCLC cells. Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) is a multifunctional cytokine that was shown to suppress metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma via inhibiting MET activity. Until now, the biological function responsible for LECT2's action in human NSCLC remains unclear. Methods: LECT2-knockout (KO) mice and NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull (NSG) mice were respectively used to investigate the effects of LECT2 on the tumorigenicity and metastasis of murine (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and human (HCC827) lung cancer cells. The effect of LECT2 on in vitro cell proliferation was evaluated, using MTS and colony formation assays. The effect of LECT2 on cell motility was evaluated using transwell migration and invasion assays. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect secreted LECT2 in plasma and media. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of LECT2 in NSCLC cells. Results: Compared to WT mice, mice with LECT2 deletion exhibited enhanced growth and metastasis of LLC cells, and survival times decreased in LLC-implanted mice. Overexpression of LECT2 in orthotopic human HCC827 xenografts in NSG mice resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. In vitro, overexpression of LECT2 or treatment with a recombinant LECT2 protein impaired the colony-forming ability and motility of NSCLC cells (HCC827 and PC9) harboring high levels of activated EGFR and MET. Mechanistic investigations found that LECT2 bound to MET and EGFR to antagonize their activation and further suppress their common downstream pathways: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Conclusion: EGFR-MET signaling is critical for aggressive behaviors of NSCLC and is recognized as a therapeutic target for NSCLC especially for patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that LECT2 functions as a suppressor of the progression of NSCLC by targeting EGFR-MET signaling.",

Between September 2013 and April 2014, health-care resource data from patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus, regardless of genotype, were collected from 8 institutions, including data related to outpatient management, emergency care, and hospitalization. The observation period was between January 2011 and December 2012. The disease state was classified as CHC, compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Results: A total of 445 patients were recruited and mean age was 60.1 ± 12.3 years. Among 155 patients with reported outcomes of antiviral therapy, 107 (69%) had sustained virologic response (SVR). The rate of patients who did not receive antiviral therapy was 52.8% (n = 235). The distribution of disease state was CHC in 307 patients (69.0%), CC in 75 (16.9%), HCC in 45 (10.1%), and DC in 18 (4.0%). All direct medical costs, whether reimbursed or nonreimbursed by the National Health Insurance System, were included. After excluding patients whose observational period was <1 month for each disease status, the mean costs per month increased as disease state progressed (CHC: 77 ± 80 USD; CC: 98 ± 94 USD; DC: 512 ± 1115 USD; HCC: 504 ± 717 USD). The mean total costs per person were 3590 ± 8783 USD, and approximately 72% of patients were reimbursed. When 44 patients with an observation period <1 month were excluded, the mean medical costs per month for patients with CHC who achieved SVR (n = 69) were significantly lower than for those (n = 215) who did not (42 ± 16 vs 79 ± 83 USD, P < 0.001). The cost also tended to be lower for patients with CC with SVR (n = 8) than for those without SVR (n = 70; 48 ± 20 vs 95 ± 96 USD, P = 0.177). The cost of antiviral therapy (pegylated interferon and ribavirin) corresponded to 19.0% of total medical costs and 53.7% of prescription/pharmacy. Conclusion: The direct medical costs increased as disease state progressed from CHC to cirrhosis or HCC. The achievement of SVR by antiviral therapy would decrease the costs.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatoblastoma are the major types of primary liver cancer in adulthood and childhood, respectively. Wnt/β-catenin signaling deregulation is one of the most frequent genetic events in hepatocarcinogenesis. APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway (APC) encodes an inhibitor of the Wnt cascade and acts as a tumor suppressor. Germline defects of the APC gene lead to familial adenomatous polyposis, and its somatic mutations occur in multiple tumor types. However, the contribution of APC in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, APC mutations and expression patterns were examined in human HCC and hepatoblastoma samples. Whether loss of Apc alone or in cooperation with other oncogenes triggers liver tumor development in vivo was also investigated. sgApc alone could not drive liver tumor formation, but synergized with activated oncogenes (YapS127A, TazS89A, and c-Met) to induce hepatocarcinogenesis. Mechanistically, Apc deletion induced the activation of β-catenin and its downstream targets in mouse liver tumors. Furthermore, Ctnnb1 ablation or TCF4-mediated transcription blockade completely prevented liver tumor formation, indicating the requirement of a functional β-catenin pathway for loss of Apc-driven hepatocarcinogenesis. This study shows that a subset of HCC patients with loss-of-function APC mutations might benefit from therapeutic strategies targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Prothrombin induced by vitamin K defi-ciency or antagonist II (PIVKA-II) is a widely used diagnostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We evaluated the correlation between alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and serum PIVKA-II levels in chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 2,528 CLD patients without HCC. Among these patients, 76 exhibited serum high PIVKA-II levels of >125 mAU/mL (group 1). We categorized 76 control patients matched by age, sex, and the presence of liver cirrhosis from the remain-ing patients who were negative for serum PIVKA-II (group 2). Results: Group 1 revealed increased antibiotic usage (23.7% vs 2.6%, p<0.001) and incidence of ALD (60.5% vs 14.5%, p<0.001) as well as elevated aspartate aminotransferase (52.5 IU/L vs 30.5 IU/L, p=0.025) and γ glutamyl transpepti-dase (67.5 IU/L vs 36.5 IU/L, p=0.005) levels compared with group 2. Further, group 1 was significantly associated with a worse Child-Pugh class than group 2. In the multivariate anal-ysis, ALD (odds ratio [OR], 7.151; p<0.001) and antibiotic us-age (OR, 5.846; p<0.001) were significantly associated with positive PIVKA-II levels. Conclusions: Our study suggests that ALD and antibiotics usage may be confounding factors when interpreting high serum PIVKA-II levels in patients without HCC. Therefore, serum PIVKA-II levels in patients with ALD or in patients administered antibiotics should be interpreted with caution. (Gut Liver, 2015;9224-230).",

    "Abstract": "Metformin is the most commonly used pharmacological therapy for type 2 diabetes. We report a genome-wide association study for glycemic response to metformin in 1,024 Scottish individuals with type 2 diabetes with replication in two cohorts including 1,783 Scottish individuals and 1,113 individuals from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study. In a combined meta-analysis, we identified a SNP, rs11212617, associated with treatment success (n = 3,920, P = 2.9 × 10(-9), odds ratio = 1.35, 95% CI 1.22-1.49) at a locus containing ATM, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene. In a rat hepatoma cell line, inhibition of ATM with KU-55933 attenuated the phosphorylation and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in response to metformin. We conclude that ATM, a gene known to be involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control, plays a role in the effect of metformin upstream of AMP-activated protein kinase, and variation in this gene alters glycemic response to metformin.",

Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate the possible antioxidant activity and hepatoprotective effects of Phytocee™ Cool on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced oxidative stress and liver damage in rats. Materials and methods: Animals were pretreated with Phytocee™ Cool for 10 days and were challenged with CCl4 (1:1 v/v) in olive oil on the 10(th) day. After 24 h of CCl4 administration blood was collected and markers of hepatocellular damage aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were evaluated. Rats were sacrificed and oxidative stress in liver was estimated using malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. Results: CCl4 caused a significant increase in serum AST, ALT, hepatic MDA and GSH levels, whereas the SOD and catalase activities were decreased. Phytocee™ Cool pretreatment attenuated the MDA, AST ALT levels and increased the activities of SOD and catalase. Conclusion: Phytocee™ Cool demonstrated antioxidant potential and hepatoprotective effects and plausibly be used in the amelioration of oxidative stress.",

Frequently co-occurring alterations in hormone receptors and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) may be relevant to mechanisms of response and resistance. Objective: To identify patterns of aberration in the PI3K and interactive pathways that might lead to targeted therapy opportunities in clinical practice. Design, setting, and participants: From January 2013 through December 2014, 19 784 consecutive tumor samples (>40 cancer types) were sent from thousands of clinicians in 60 countries to a single commercial laboratory for molecular profiling, including next generation sequencing, protein expression (immunohistochemical analysis [IHC]), and gene amplification (fluorescent in situ hybridization or chromogenic in situ hybridization). Main outcomes and measures: Patterns in targetable genomic and proteomic alterations in the PI3K pathway and coincidence with hormone receptor and HER2 alterations. Exposures: Molecular profiling across solid tumors. Results: Overall, 38% of patients had an alteration in 1 or more PI3K pathway components, most commonly phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss (by IHC) (30% of all patients), followed by mutations in PIK3CA (13%), PTEN (6%), or AKT1 (1%). Seventy percent of patients with endometrial cancer and more than 50% of patients with breast, prostate, anal, hepatocellular, colorectal, and cervical cancer exhibited alterations in at least 1 PI3K pathway gene and/or gene product. Examples of frequent aberrations included PTEN loss in hepatocellular (57% of patients), colorectal (48%), gastric (36%), prostate (52%), and endometrial cancer (49%); PIK3CA mutations in endometrial (37%), breast (31%), cervical (29%), and anal cancer (27%). PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1 mutations occurred more frequently in the presence of hormone receptor overexpression (androgen, progesterone, or estrogen receptor). PIK3CA mutations were also more common in the HER2-positive than in the HER2-negative group; the opposite pattern was seen for PTEN mutation or PTEN loss. Conclusions and relevance: PI3K pathway aberrations are among the most common in cancer. They do not segregate by classic cancer histologic characteristics. Patterns of biomarker coalterations involving HER2 and hormone receptors may be important for optimizing combination treatments across cancer types.",

    "Abstract": "Background & objective: It has been shown that the combined use of alcohol before radiofrequency ablation (RFA) helps to augment the therapeutic advantage of RFA. The present study was conducted to compare the outcome of treatment with RFA alone and RFA with alcohol as ablative technique in patients with small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), who were not candidates for surgery. Methods: Fifty patients with chronic liver disease and concurrent HCC were enrolled in this prospective study. The patients were treated with either RFA alone (n=25) or RFA combined with alcohol (n=25). Patient outcome was evaluated, and the tumour recurrence and survival of the patients were assessed in the two groups. Results: The survival rates at six months in patients who completed at least six months of follow up were 84 and 80 per cent in patients treated with RFA alone and combination therapy, respectively. During the follow up period, 11 and four patients treated with RFA alone showed local and distant intrahepatic tumour recurrence, respectively. All local recurrences were at one to 18 months of the follow up period. The distant recurrences occurred at 6-36 months of the follow up period. During the follow up period, eight and six patients treated with combination therapy showed local and distant intrahepatic tumour recurrence, respectively. All local recurrences were at 1.5-15 months during the follow up period. The distant intrahepatic recurrences occurred at 6-72 months during the follow up period. Interpretation & conclusions: No significant difference was seen between the survival time of the patients treated with RFA alone and RFA with alcohol as well as in the local recurrences and distant intrahepatic recurrences in RFA compared to RFA and alcohol group patients. Combined use of RFA and alcohol did not improve the local tumour control and survival in patients with HCC compared to RFA alone.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and chemoresistance is the main obstacle for effective treatments of HCC. Accumulating studies indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the chemoresistance of human carcinoma. However, the functional role of HANR in autophagy-mediated chemoresistance of HCC is unknown. Methods: The expressions of HANR, miR-29b and ATG9A in tissues and cell lines were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The expression of autophagy-related protein LC3-I and LC3-II was evaluated by Western blotting. The cell viability and apoptosis were examined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase activity assay were applied to determine the downstream target gene of HANR or miR-29b. Xenograft experiment was used to detect the effect of HANR on tumor growth. Results: In the present study, we demonstrated that HANR was notably overexpressed in sorafenib-resistant HepG2 (HepG2/sora) and sorafenib-resistant Huh7 (Huh7/sora) cells, and HANR enhanced sorafenib resistance by facilitating autophagy in HepG2/sora and Huh7/sora cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR‑29b could directly interact with HANR and abolished HANR-induced sorafenib resistance by suppressing autophagy in HepG2/sora and Huh7/sora cells. Moreover, ATG9A was validated as a target of miR-29b and its overexpression obviously reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-29b on sorafenib resistance and autophagy. In addition, HANR could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to upregulate ATG9A expression by sponging miR-29b. Hence, HANR increased autophagy-related sorafenib resistance via inhibiting the miR-29b/ATG9A axis in HepG2/sora and Huh7/sora cells, indicating that it may be a potential target to prevent chemoresistance of HCC. Conclusion: Our study revealed HANR enhanced sorafenib resistance by acting as an autophagy promoter by regulating miR-29b/ATG9A axis in sorafenib‑resistant HCC cells and might provide potential therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment.",

Methods: From February 2007 to January 2015, clinical outcomes of thirty four patients with HCC receiving RFA or NAHR were compared, retrospectively. Results: There was no difference of patient and tumor characteristic between the two groups that received RFA or NAHR. The 1, 2, and 3-year recurrence rates following RFA were 32.2%, 32.2% and 59.3% respectively, and 6.7%, 33.3% and 33.3% following NAHR respectively (p=0.287). The 1, 2 and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates following RFA were 100%, 88.9% and 76.2% respectively, and 100%, 85.6% and 85.6%, respectively, following NAHR (p=0.869). We did not find a definite statistical difference in recurrence rate and OS rate between the two groups. In the multivariate analysis, number of tumor was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence and albumin was an independent prognostic factor for OS. Conclusions: We recommend non-anatomical hepatic resection rather than intraoperative RFA in small sized HCC, due to a higher recurrence rate in intraoperative RFA. Intraoperative RFA was inferior to non-anatomical hepatic resection in terms of recurrence rate. We need to select the optimal treatment considering liver function and possibility of recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for development and organogenesis. Wnt signaling stabilizes beta-catenin, which accumulates in the cytoplasm, binds to 1-cell factor (TCF; also known as lymphocyte enhancer-binding factor, LEF) and then upregulates downstream genes. Mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding beta-catenin) or APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) have been reported in human neoplasms including colon cancers and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Because HCC5 tend to show accumulation of beta-catenin more often than mutations in CTNNB1, we looked for mutations in AXIN1, encoding a key factor for Wnt signaling, in 6 HCC cell lines and 100 primary HCC5. Among the 4 cell lines and 87 HCC5 in which we did not detect CTNNB1 mutations, we identified AXIN1 mutations in 3 cell lines and 6 mutations in 5 of the primary HCCs. In cell lines containing mutations in either gene, we observed increased DNA binding of TCF associated with beta-catenin in nuclei. Adenovirus mediated gene transfer of wild-type AXINI induced apoptosis in hepatocellular and colorectal cancer cells that had accumulated beta-catenin as a consequence of either APC, CTNNB1 or AXIN1 mutation, suggesting that axin may be an effective therapeutic molecule for suppressing growth of hepatocellular and colorectal cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Microvascular invasion (MVI) is the most important risk factor associated with early postoperative recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant treatment for preventing recurrence in HCC patients with MVI has not been assessed. This study investigated the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC patients with MVI. Materials and methods: From July 2008 to December 2016, 117 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients with MVI were retrospectively divided into two groups based on postoperative adjuvant treatments. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to adjust for significant differences in baseline characteristics. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of the two groups were analyzed before and after PSM. Results: Of all patients, the RT group had significantly smaller tumor size and milder MVI classification. PSM analysis created 46 pairs of patients. After matching, the two groups of patients were similar in baseline characteristics. Multivariate analysis indicated that tumor size, MVI classification, and postoperative treatment strategies were independently associated with RFS; tumor size and MVI classification were independently associated with OS. Similar multivariate analysis results were demonstrated after matching propensity score. Survival analysis revealed that the estimated median RFS and OS of patients with RT and TACE were 25.74±8.12 vs 9.18±1.67 months (P=0.003) and 60.69±7.36 vs 36.53±5.34 months (P=0.262), respectively. The RT group had significantly longer RFS than the TACE group. Conclusion: Postoperative adjuvant RT offers better RFS for HCC patients with MVI than TACE.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate whether hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) histology is associated with clinical and computed tomographic/magnetic resonance imaging features and locoregional therapy (LRT) outcomes. Subjects and methods: This single-center retrospective study included 124 consecutive patients (92 men, median age 59 years) with 132 HCC diagnosed by biopsy between 2008 and 2017 before LRT. Patients underwent chemoembolization (n = 51, 41%), ablation (n = 41, 33%), yttrium-90 radioembolization (n = 17, 13%), and chemoembolization/ablation (n = 15, 12%). Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage was 0/A (n = 48, 38%), B (n = 33, 26%), C (n = 27, 22%), and D (n = 16, 13%). Edmondson-Steiner (ES) grade and cytology were correlated with baseline features and radiologic response using logistic regression. Time to progression (TTP) and transplant-free survival (TFS) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models. Results: High ES grade was associated with α-fetoprotein (AFP) >50 ng/ml (odds ratio [OR] 4.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-13.9; P < 0.01), tumor diameter >5 cm (OR 3.1, 95% CI: 1.1-9.0; P < 0.05), infiltrative appearance (OR 5.0, 95% CI: 1.5-16.2; P < 0.01), and BCLC Stage C (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 1.3-16.4; P = 0.02). Clear-cell subtype was associated with non-viral cirrhosis (OR 5.3, 95% CI: 1.6-17.2; P < 0.01) and atypical enhancement (OR 3.1, 95% CI: 1.0-9.3; P < 0.05). AFP, BCLC Stage B, and diameter were associated with reduced TTP and TFS (P < 0.05). Neither ES grade nor clear-cell subtype was associated with objective response (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 0.7- 7.4; P = 0.15 and OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.4-3.4; P = 0.87, respectively), TTP (P > 0.20), or TFS (P > 0.90) on univariate or stratified analysis. Conclusion: Histologic grade is associated with aggressive tumor features, while clear-cell HCC is associated with non-viral cirrhosis and atypical enhancement. Unlike AFP, BCLC stage, and tumor size, histologic features were not associated with LRT outcomes, supporting biopsy deferral for imaging diagnosed HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Yttrium-90 (Y90)-radioembolisation (RE) significantly regresses locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and delays disease progression. The current study is designed to deeply interrogate the immunological impact of Y90-RE, which elicits a sustained therapeutic response. Design: Time-of-flight mass cytometry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were used to analyse the immune landscapes of tumour-infiltrating leucocytes (TILs), tumour tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at different time points before and after Y90-RE. Results: TILs isolated after Y90-RE exhibited signs of local immune activation: higher expression of granzyme B (GB) and infiltration of CD8+ T cells, CD56+ NK cells and CD8+ CD56+ NKT cells. NGS confirmed the upregulation of genes involved in innate and adaptive immune activation in Y90-RE-treated tumours. Chemotactic pathways involving CCL5 and CXCL16 correlated with the recruitment of activated GB+CD8+ T cells to the Y90-RE-treated tumours. When comparing PBMCs before and after Y90-RE, we observed an increase in tumour necrosis factor-α on both the CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as well as an increase in percentage of antigen-presenting cells after Y90-RE, implying a systemic immune activation. Interestingly, a high percentage of PD-1+/Tim-3+CD8+ T cells coexpressing the homing receptors CCR5 and CXCR6 denoted Y90-RE responders. A prediction model was also built to identify sustained responders to Y90-RE based on the immune profiles from pretreatment PBMCs. Conclusion: High-dimensional analysis of tumour and systemic immune landscapes identified local and systemic immune activation that corresponded to the sustained response to Y90-RE. Potential biomarkers associated with a positive clinical response were identified and a prediction model was built to identify sustained responders prior to treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Still in real-world practice, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). This study compared the therapeutic effectiveness of initial TACE treatment and initial sorafenib treatment in advanced HCC patients. Patient and methods: Advanced HCC patients initially treated with sorafenib or TACE were included in this study. Treatment crossover due to an unfavorable response to initial treatment was allowed. Propensity score (PS) matching was applied for balancing baseline characteristics. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and the secondary outcomes included tumor response. Results: A total of 554 patients were included in this study: 85 were initially treated with sorafenib (the sorafenib-first group) and 469 with TACE (the TACE-first group). In the entire cohort, the TACE-first group was associated with lower risk of death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=0.75, P=0.04]. In the PS-matched cohort (85 patients per group), the TACE-first group showed longer OS than the sorafenib-first group in both univariable (HR=0.68, P=0.02) and multivariable analyses (adjusted HR=0.58, P=0.002). Specifically, within both the entire and the PS-matched cohorts, the TACE-first group showed longer OS in subgroups with major portal vein tumor thrombosis (HR=0.72, P=0.048; HR=0.52, P=0.003) or infiltrative HCC (HR=0.42, P<0.001; HR=0.30, P=0.004, respectively). The objective response rate was higher in the TACE-first group (29.3% vs 14.7%, P=0.03) within the PS-matched cohort. Conclusion: For advanced HCC, initial TACE leads to longer OS with a more favorable tumor response than initial sorafenib treatment. Intrahepatic tumor control with initial locoregional therapy may be a potent strategy for advanced HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Liver resection (LR) is the primary treatment method for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Improving surgical safety and reducing surgical morbidity and mortality is important for patients receiving LR. Various devices have been developed to facilitate vascular transection to reduce intraoperative blood loss, which is considered to be a predictor of poor surgical outcomes in patients undergoing LR. Vascular staplers have been widely applied for the division of major vascular and biliary structures in the process of LR; however, when and how to use these tools remains controversial. This review aims to report the rationality and necessity of using vascular staplers in vessel transection during liver surgery. Due to the risk of intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage and biliary fistula, the process of transection of the portal pedicle and hepatic vein is a crucial step during LR. Stapling represents a vascular dissection technique that is widely used in laparoscopic LR and has then been popularized in open LR. Advocates argue that stapler transection methods provide several advantages, including diminished blood loss, fewer transfusion requirements and shorter operative times. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate those benefits when using these tools compared with the simple clamp-crushing technique. Using the stapler vascular transection method resulted in smaller surgical margins and similar surgical outcomes compared with those of the clamp-crushing vascular transection method. However, the intraoperative use of vascular staplers may significantly increase the financial burden of liver resection for patients with HCC, while not improving short- and long-term outcomes. Therefore, it has been suggested that vascular staplers should not be routinely used in LR. The current review discussed the above points and recommended that the stapling transection of the portal pedicle and hepatic vein should be applied during laparoscopic LR in a rational manner. However, the suturing ligation method should be routinely used in open LR.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Obesity is a contributor to the global burden of chronic diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH cirrhosis is becoming a leading indication for liver transplant (LT). Obese transplanted patients have higher morbidity and mortality rates. One strategy, to improve the outcomes in these patients, includes bariatric surgery at the time of LT. Herein we report the first European combined LT and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Case presentation: A 53 years old woman with Hepatocellular carcinoma and Hepatitis C virus related cirrhosis, was referred to our unit. She also presented with severe morbid obesity (BMI 40kg/m2) and insulin-dependent diabetes. Once listed for LT, she was assessed by the bariatric surgery team to undergo a combined LT/SG. At the time of transplantation the patient had a model for end-stage liver disease calculated score of 14 and a BMI of 38kg/m2. The LT was performed using a deceased donor. An experienced bariatric surgeon, following completion of the LT, performed the SG. Operation time was 8h and 50min. The patient had an uneventful recovery and is currently alive, 5 months after the combined procedure, with normal allograft function, significant weight loss (BMI=29kg/m2), and diabetes resolution. Conclusion: Despite the ideal approach to the management of the obese LT patients remains unknown, we strongly support the combined procedure during LT in selected patients, offering advantages in terms of allograft and patient survival, maintenance of weigh loss that will ultimately reduce obese related co-morbidities.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To identify the SPINK1 or SPINK1-based model as a more reliable biomarker for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Serum samples and related laboratory parameters were collected from 540 subjects (119 healthy donors, 113 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 122 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 186 patients with HCC). SPINK1 was determined by ELISA assay. Differences in each variable were compared by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis was conducted to compare the diagnostic efficiency of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), SPINK1, and a SPINK1-based combine model constructed by binary Logistic regression. Results: In detecting HCC using the other three groups as control, ROC curve analysis revealed that SPINK1 alone reached AUC of 0.899 (0.866-0.933), with the sensitivity of 0.812 of and specificity of 0.953. The combined model increased the AUC to 0.945 (0.926-0.964) with the sensitivity and specificity of 0.860 and 0.910, respectively. For AFP, significantly lower AUC (p < 0.0001) was shown, which was 0.695 (0.645-0.745) with the sensitivity and specificity of 0.634 and 0.718, respectively. In discriminating HCC from liver disease control, AUC of SPINK1 was 0.863(0.826-0.894), the sensitivity and specificity were 0.823 and 0.906, respectively. For combined model, the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.915 (0.884-0.940), 0.863, and 0.916, respectively. For detecting early-stage HCC, SPINK1 and combined model achieved the sensitivity of 0.788 and 0.818, respectively, much higher than AFP of 0.485 (p < 0.05); however, the difference between SPINK1 and combined model was not statistically significant (p = 1). Conclusion: We provided solid evidence for SPINK1 as a robust serological tool for HCC diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Currently speaking, it is noted that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been the most widely used treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring in patients. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the incidence of insufficient RFA (IRFA) may result in the identified rapid progression of residual HCC in the patient, which can greatly hinder the effectiveness and patient reported benefits of utilizing this technique. Although many efforts have been proposed, the underlying mechanisms triggering the rapid progression of residual HCC after IRFA have not yet been fully clarified through current research literature reviews. It was shown in this study that cell proliferation, migration and invasion of residual HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells were significantly increased after the IRFA was simulated in vitro. In other words, it is noted that IRFA could do this by enhancing the image of autophagy of the residual HCC cell via the HIF-1α/BNIP3 pathway. Consequently, the down-regulation of BNIP3 may result in the inhibition of the residual HCC cell progression and autophagy after IRFA. Our present study results suggest that IRFA could promote residual HCC cell progression in vitro by enhancing autophagy via the HIF-1α/BNIP3 pathway. For this reason, it is noted that the targeting of the BNIP3 may be useful in preventing the rapid growth and metastasis of residual HCC after IRFA. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(4): 277-282].",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To study the effects of warm ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury on hepatic morphology at the ultrastructural level and to analyze the expression of the thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX) systems. Methods: Eleven patients undergoing liver resection were subjected to portal triad clamping (PTC). Liver biopsies were collected at three time points; first prior to PTC (baseline), 20 min after PTC (post-ischemia) and 20 min after reperfusion (post-reperfusion). Electron microscopy and morphometry were used to study and quantify ultrastructural changes, respectively. Additionally, gene expression analysis of TRX and GRX isoforms was performed by quantitative PCR. For further validation of redox protein status, immunogold staining was performed for the isoforms GRX1 and TRX1. Results: Post-ischemia, a significant loss of the liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) lining was observed (P = 0.0003) accompanied by a decrease of hepatocyte microvilli in the space of Disse. Hepatocellular morphology was well preserved apart from the appearance of crystalline mitochondrial inclusions in 7 out of 11 patients. Post-reperfusion biopsies had similar features as post-ischemia with the exception of signs of a reactivation of the LSECs. No changes in the expression of redox-regulatory genes could be observed at mRNA level of the isoforms of the TRX family but immunoelectron microscopy indicated a redistribution of TRX1 within the cell. Conclusion: At the ultrastructural level, the major impact of hepatic warm I/R injury after PTC was borne by the LSECs with detachment and reactivation at ischemia and reperfusion, respectively. Hepatocytes morphology were well preserved. Crystalline inclusions in mitochondria were observed in the hepatocyte after ischemia.",

However, in both Huh-7 human hepatoma cells and Hc human normal hepatocytes, when infected with an adenovirus expressing a mutated form of IkappaBalpha (Ad5IkappaB), which almost completely blocks NF-kappaB activation, >80% of the cells survived 24 h after TNF-alpha stimulation. Here, we report that TNF-alpha activates other antiapoptotic factors, such as sphingosine kinase (SphK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt kinase. Pretreatment of cells with N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), an inhibitor of SphK, or LY 294002, an inhibitor of PI3K that acts upstream of Akt, increased the number of apoptotic cells induced by TNF-alpha in Ad5IkappaB-infected Huh-7 and Hc cells. TNF-alpha-induced activations of PI3K and Akt were inhibited by DMS. In contrast, exogenous sphingosine 1-phosphate, a product of SphK, was found to activate Akt and partially rescued the cells from TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Although Akt has been reported to activate NF-kappaB, DMS and LY 294002 failed to prevent TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, suggesting that the antiapoptotic effects of SphK and Akt are independent of NF-kappaB. Furthermore, apoptosis mediated by Fas ligand (FasL) involving Akt activation also was potentiated by DMS pretreatment in Hc cells. Sphingosine 1-phosphate administration partially protected cells from FasL-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that not only NF-kappaB but also SphK and PI3K/Akt are involved in the signaling pathway(s) for protection of human hepatocytes from the apoptotic action of TNF-alpha and probably FasL.",

    "Abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is considered as a promising anticancer agent, it induced apoptosis in cancer cells selectively without damaging the normal tissue cells. However, the resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL limits its application. Since the cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be responsible for the treatment failure in multiple cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the aim of this study was to investigate the strategies to increase the sensitivity of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) to TRAIL. In the present study, we observed significant upregulation of miR-25 in LCSCs compared with the non-CSCs. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of miR-25 by its antisense oligonucleotide (anti‑miR-25) significantly increased the sensitivity of LCSCs to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The gene of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which is a natural inhibitor of PI3K, was found to be directly regulated by miR-25 in HepG2‑CSCs. We demonstrated that knockdown of miR-25 increased the expression of PTEN. Mechanistically, inhibition of Bad phosphorylation, which is regulated by the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, is essential for the functional roles of anti-miR-25 in HepG2-CSCs. In conclusion, our findings indicate that overexpression of miR-25 is associated with the low-sensitivity to TRAIL in LCSCs. Knockdown of miR-25 may represent a potential strategy for increasing the efficacy of TRAIL by targeting the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/Bad signaling pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Aim of the study: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause a chronic liver infection which could then develop into fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Today the diagnosis of liver fibrosis also includes the use of biomarkers. The purpose of our study was to determine the ability of the fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4) and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio (APRI) to predict the severity of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Material and methods: Medical records of 106 patients with HCV-related liver fibrosis were analyzed. All patients underwent clinical examination, blood tests (complete blood count, total bilirubin, etc.) and transient elastography. FIB-4 and APRI were calculated for each patient. Results: Twenty-six patients (24.52%) had F4 fibrosis, 80 patients (75.48%) had non-F4 fibrosis (F0-F3). There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between non-F4 fibrosis patients and F4 fibrosis patients in many parameters, including APRI (F4 fibrosis patients had higher values: 2.06 ±3.22 compared to 0.68 ±0.76 of the non-F4 group; p = 0.044) and FIB-4 (F4 fibrosis patients had higher values: 4.84 ±4.14 compared to 2.29 ±2.90 of the non-F4 group; p = 0.006). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for APRI and FIB-4 revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of FIB-4 was 0.855 (CI: 0.813-0.936), while the APRI score had an AUC of 0.767 (CI: 0.79-0.932). Conclusions: In this study, patients with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis were found to have a higher FIB-4 value than APRI in the context of chronic hepatitis C.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: TRAIL is a promising anticancer agent that has the potential to sensitize a wide variety of cancer or transformed cells by inducing apoptosis. However, resistance to TRAIL is a growing concern. Current manuscript aimed to employ combination treatment to investigate resveratrol induced TRAIL sensitization in NSCLC. Method: A549 and HCC-15 cells were used in an experimental design. Cell viability was determined by morphological image, crystal violet staining and MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by LDH assay, Annexin V and DAPI staining. Autophagy and apoptosis indicator protein were examined by western blotting. TEM and puncta assay was carried out to evaluate the autophagy. MTP and ROS activity was evaluated by JC-1 and H2DCFDA staining. Findings: Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound capable of activation of tumor suppressor p53 and its pro-apoptotic modulator PUMA. Herein, we showed the p53-independent apoptosis by decrease the expression of phosphorylated Akt-mediated suppression of NF-κB that is also substantiated with the downregulation of anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in NSCLC, resulting in an attenuation of TRAIL resistance in combined treatment. Furthermore, apoptosis was induced in TRAIL-resistant lung cancer cells with a co-treatment of resveratrol and TRAIL assessed by the loss of MMP, ROS generations which resulting the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, autophagy flux was not affected by resveratrol-induced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in NSCLC. Significance: Overall, targeting the NF-κB (p65) pathway via resveratrol attenuates TRAIL resistance and induces TRAIL-mediated apoptosis which could be the effective TRAIL-based cancer therapy regimen.",

    "Abstract": "Inhibitor of Growth 3 (ING3) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose expression is lost in tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. In the present study, we show that ING3-depleted human cells and yeast cells deleted for its ortholog YNG2 are sensitive to DNA damage suggesting a conserved role in response to such stress. In human cells, ING3 is recruited to DNA double strand breaks and is required for ATM activation. Remarkably, in response to doxorubicin, ATM activation is dependent on ING3 but not on TIP60, whose recruitment to DNA breaks also depends on ING3. These events lead to ATM-mediated phosphorylation of NBS1 and the subsequent recruitment of RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1, and BRCA1, which are major mediators of the DNA damage response. Accordingly, upon genotoxic stress, DNA repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) were impaired in absence of ING3. Finally, immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR), a physiological mechanism requiring NHEJ repair, was impaired in the absence of ING3. Since deregulation of DNA double strand break repair is associated with genomic instability, we propose a novel function of ING3 as a caretaker tumor suppressor involved in the DNA damage signaling and repair.",

    "Abstract": "Resistance to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a frequently found phenotype in human malignancies. The recent identification of Smad6 and Smad7, both anti-Smads which inhibit TGF-beta signaling, raises a possibility that constitutive activation of the anti-Smads by a somatic mutation may impair the TGF-beta signaling pathway. We tested this hypothesis by screening the entire coding sequences of these anti-Smads for mutations in 52 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples using polymerase chain reaction - single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. We detected no mutations, but found 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Smad6 gene and 2 SNPs in the Smad7 gene. These results suggest that mutations of the Smad6 and Smad7 genes are not the main cause of the TGF-beta resistance in human HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A (MTS1/p16), located on chromosome 9p21, is inactivated in a variety of tumors including melanomas and tumors of the biliary tract, pancreas, and stomach. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this gene is inactivated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Twenty-three primary HCCs and four HCC cell lines were examined. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was performed using eight polymorphic markers immediately surrounding CDKN2A, and showed a contiguous region of loss, with the two most commonly deleted markers being D9S1604, located between the p16 and p15 genes, at which 7 of 13 informative tumors (54%) showed loss, and D9S171, with 4 of 14 LOH (29%). Exons 1, 2, and 3 of CDKN2A were amplified by polymerase chain reaction to detect homozygous deletions, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed to screen for mutations. No homozygous deletions were detected in any sample. SSCP and sequence analysis showed the same nucleotide change at codon 148 in four tumors. This has been reported elsewhere as a polymorphism. One of these four tumors also contained a mutation at codon 119, resulting in the substitution of an acidic amino acid for a basic one. It is concluded that CDKN2A is infrequently deleted or mutated in HCC. The region of allelic loss upstream from CDKN2A might result in inactivation of regulatory sequences important in the expression of this gene; alternatively, a second tumor suppressor gene may be present in the region 9p21-22, proximal to CDKN2A. These possibilities require further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: E-cadherin and β-catenin are crucial components of the cell-cell adhesion complex. Their loss has often been associated with tumour metastasis and poor clinical outcome. Both loss of E-cadherin at the cell membrane and a stabilizing mutation in CTNNB1 (β-catenin gene) have been associated with ovarian, colorectal, hepatocellular and nonmelanoma skin cancer, such as squamous and basal cell carcinomas. Absence of E-cadherin may be caused by promoter hypermethylation of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1). Objectives: To determine the role of E-cadherin promoter hypermethylation and CTNNB1 gene mutation in the aggressive behaviour of sebaceous gland carcinoma of the eyelid. Methods: Thirty-six cases of sebaceous gland carcinoma were subjected to E-cadherin methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and mutational analysis for the CTNNB1 gene. E-cadherin and β-catenin staining was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Results were correlated with the clinicopathological features of sebaceous gland carcinoma. Results: nMethylation of the E-cadherin promoter region was detected in 72% of eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma cases and loss of E-cadherin immunostaining in 83%. E-cadherin promoter hypermethylation showed a significant association with the loss of membranous E-cadherin (P = 0·038) and it was of borderline significance with reduced disease-free survival (P = 0·05). It was also found to be associated with advanced age (73%), tumour size ≥ 2 cm (77%), orbital invasion (83%), lymph node metastasis (60%), tumour recurrence (60%) and poor histological differentiation (90%). DNA sequencing revealed no stabilizing β-catenin gene mutation in sebaceous gland carcinoma. Loss of membranous β-catenin was observed in 61% cases, which associated significantly with both E-cadherin promoter methylation (P = 0·0262) and loss of E-cadherin membranous localization (P=0·0015). Conclusion: Epigenetic inactivation of the E-cadherin gene causes loss of membrane-bound E-cadherin and could contribute to the reduced disease-free survival in eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma. Mutations in the β-catenin gene do not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Increased red blood cell count (Erythrocytosis) is an important paraneoplastic syndrome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is a significant risk factor for lethal lung artery thromboembolism. HCC-associated erythrocytosis is partially caused by the ability of several HCC cells to produce erythropoietin (EPO). Prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) is an enzyme encoded by the gene EGLN1. The best-known function of PHD2 is to mediate the oxygen-dependent degradation of the labile α-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). However, there is increasing evidence that PHD2 also regulates HIF-independent pathways by interacting with other substrates. Methods: In the EPO-producing human HCC cell line HepG2, the expression of PHD2 gene was silenced with siRNA. EPO production was estimated using quantitative PCR and ELISA. Results: In HepG2 cells, PHD2 suppresses the activity of TGF-β1 pathway and consequently maintains the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α), an important transcription factor promoting the EPO expression in hepatocytes. PHD2 knockdown caused a marked reduction of EPO production. HIF seemed not to be involved in this biology. Conclusion: Our findings show that PHD2 represents a potential contributing factor for HCC-associated erythrocytosis. Selective inhibition of PHD2 in HCC cells might be considered as a new way to manage erythrocytosis in HCC patients.",

Expression of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) of p53, p16, and p15 gene was found to correlate with a deletion of these genes. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and PCR-based microsatellite polymorphism analysis techniques were used. Results: A high frequency of LOH was detected on chromosome 9p24 at locus D9S54 (61.8%) and 9p21, concentrated at loci D9S1747 (52.4%) and D9S1752 (51.8%). On chromosome 17, high frequent LOH was concentrated on 17p at the p53 gene locus (53.8%) and locus D17S520 (52.8%). p53 protein expression was increased in HCC, which correlated with p53 gene loss. Expression of p16 and p15 protein decreased in HCC when LOH occurred at locus D9S1752 (p15 gene locus) or at locus D9S1747 and D9S1748 (p16 gene is located between these 2 loci). LOH at the p53 gene and p15 gene loci was closely associated with HBV and HCV co-infection in HCC. No significant relationship between LOH and HCC clinico-pathological outcomes was observed. Conclusion: High frequency LOH occurs on chromosomes 9p and 17 in HCC in Chinese patients. Such sites may contain several putative tumor suppressor genes critically involved in the development and/or progression of HCC. Deletion of p53, p16, or p15 tumor suppressor genes may cause abnormal expression of the protein product of these genes. HBV and/or HCV infection may be closely associated with LOH p53 and/or p15 gene expression.",

We performed RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis of tumors. We knocked down or overexpressed NOTCH1 and MYC in HCC cells and analyzed proliferation. We measured levels of phosphorylated ABL1, MYC, and NOTCH1 by immunohistochemical analysis of an HCC tissue microarray. Results: HCC tissues had higher levels of ABL1 than non-tumor liver tissues, which correlated with shorter survival times of patients. HepWT mice with the MET and catenin β1 transposons developed liver tumors and survived a median 64 days; HepAbl-/- mice with these transposons developed tumors that were 50% smaller and survived a median 81 days. Knockdown of ABL1 in human HCC cells reduced proliferation, growth as xenograft tumors in mice, and expression of MYC, which reduced expression of NOTCH1. Knockdown of NOTCH1 or MYC in HCC cells significantly reduced cell growth. NOTCH1 or MYC overexpression in human HCC cells promoted proliferation and rescued the phenotype caused by ABL1 knockdown. The level of phosphorylated (activated) ABL1 correlated with levels of MYC and NOTCH1 in human HCC specimens. Nilotinib decreased expression of MYC and NOTCH1 in HCC cell lines, reduced the growth of xenograft tumors in mice, and slowed growth of liver tumors in mice with MET and catenin β1 transposons, reducing tumor levels of MYC and NOTCH1. Conclusions: HCC samples have increased levels of ABL1 compared with nontumor liver tissues, and increased levels of ABL1 correlate with shorter survival times of patients. Loss or inhibition of ABL1 reduces proliferation of HCC cells and slows growth of liver tumors in mice. Inhibitors of ABL1 might be used for treatment of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) patients, both dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells are functionally impaired and consequently the HBV-specific cellular immune responses are downregulated. The present study aims to investigate whether monocyte-derived DC (MoDCs)-pulsed-HBV subviral particles (HBVsvp) can polarize Th1 cells to induce HBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) responses in CHB patients. Methods and materials: To this end, the human hepatoma HepG2.2.15 cell line was used to produce HBVsvp as a culturing system, and HBVsvp were concentrated for highly virus titer using the polyethylene glycol protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), collected from CHB patients and healthy donors, were differentiated into MoDCs and T cells. PBMCs-derived MoDCs were first pulsed with HBVsvp and then cultured with PBMCs-derived T cells. MoDCs and/or T subsets cells were identified for phenotypic activation by FACS analysis. The cytokine secretion of IL-4, IL-12, and IFN-γ in the culture supernatants was detected. Results: The MoDCs were restored for their activation upon pulsing with HBVsvp in vitro, as identified by significantly overexpression of both CD86 and HLA-DR, and overproduction of IL-4 and IL-12. Furthermore, MoDCs-pulsed-HBVsvp induced Th1 frequencies and activated HBV-specific CTL to produce significantly highest amount of IFN-γ. Enhanced HBV-specific CTL led to strong cytolytic capacity against HepG2.2.15. Conclusion: Overall, our data suggest that in vitro activation of MoDCs with HBVsvp overcomes the functionally impaired DCs and T cells in CHB patients offering a promising tool for therapeutic or vaccine-based approaches against HBV.",

    "Abstract": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer with dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic options. By performing RNA- and exome-sequencing analyses, we report a novel fusion event, FGFR2-PPHLN1 (16%), and damaging mutations in the ARAF oncogene (11%). Here we demonstrate that the chromosomal translocation t(10;12)(q26;q12) leading to FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion possesses transforming and oncogenic activity, which is successfully inhibited by a selective FGFR2 inhibitor in vitro. Among the ARAF mutations, N217I and G322S lead to activation of the pathway and N217I shows oncogenic potential in vitro. Screening of a cohort of 107 iCCA patients reveals that FGFR2 fusions represent the most recurrent targetable alteration (45%, 17/107), while they are rarely present in other primary liver tumours (0/100 of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); 1/21 of mixed iCCA-HCC). Taken together, around 70% of iCCA patients harbour at least one actionable molecular alteration (FGFR2 fusions, IDH1/2, ARAF, KRAS, BRAF and FGF19) that is amenable for therapeutic targeting.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Specific mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been reported from several parts of the world, but to the authors' knowledge to date the status of this gene has not been studied in HCC patients in India, where HCC is one of the major cancers and the frequency of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and exposure to dietary aflatoxin B(1) is very high. The most frequent mutation of the p53 gene in HCC is an AGG(Arg) to AGT(Ser) missense mutation at codon 249 of exon 7. Methods: Liver biopsy specimens from 21 HCC patients and 10 healthy controls were obtained through surgery or by needle biopsy technique. Phenol-chloroform-extracted DNA specimens were employed for the detection of HBV infection and p53 gene mutations. Nucleotide mutations of exons 4-9 of the p53 gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand confirmation polymorphism, and direct sequencing. Third-generation sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for the serologic detection of HBV and HCV infection. Results: Analysis of exons 4-9 of the p53 gene revealed only 3 mutations (3 of 21 specimens, 14.28%; 95% confidence interval, -0.7-29.3), 2 mutations at codon 249 showing G-->T transversions, and 1 mutation (4.7%) at codon 250 with a C-->T transition. The base substitutions at the third base of codon 249 resulted in a missense mutation leading to a change in amino acid from arginine to serine whereas at codon 250 it caused a change from proline to serine. Dot blot hybridization and PCR for HBV DNA from HCCs revealed 58.8% (10 of 17 specimens) and 90. 47% (19 of 21 specimens), positivity, respectively. ELISA for hepatitis B virus surface antigen in serum showed a positivity of 71. 42% (15 of 21 specimens), but there was only 40% positivity (8 of 20 specimens) for hepatitis B virus envelope antigen whereas 6 of 17 patients (35.29%) showed the presence of antibodies against hepatitis B virus envelope protein. No patient was found to be positive for the HCV antibody. Conclusions: The very low frequency of p53 mutations and the extremely high frequency of HBV infection (> 90%) in HCC indicate that the mutations in the p53 gene frequently found in HCC reported from different endemic areas of the world may not play a direct role in the development of HCC in India. HBV infection and, possibly, exposure to the dietary aflatoxin B(1) appear to play major roles in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC in India.",

    "Abstract": "To examine the significance of mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma in a high-prevalence area for hepatitis B viral infection but a low-exposure area for aflatoxin B1, the spectrum of p53 gene mutations was examined in 21 tumour samples from Hong Kong Chinese patients, all of whom were HBsAg positive. DNA sequencing covering exons 5 to 9 of the p53 gene and Hae III restriction enzyme digestion for preliminary assessment of mutation at codon 249 were performed. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies was done on both tumour and nontumour liver tissues. Six tumours (28.6%) showed a p53 mutation and all were point mutations. Of the six point mutations, two (9.5%) were at codon 249 and both were G to T transversions (AGG-->ATG and AGG-->AGT transversions). The remaining point mutations were transversions scattered at codon 172 (exon 5), 214 (exon 6), 273 (exon 8) and 330 (exon 9). Mutated p53 protein was detected in five of these six cases with demonstrable point mutations by DNA sequencing, in contrast to none detected in all of the 15 cases without demonstrable point mutations. The presence of p53 mutations, including those at codon 249, did not show a significant association with tumour size, sex, age, tumour invasiveness in terms of liver invasion, microsatellites and venous permeation, cirrhosis and encapsulation, but tumours with low cellular differentiation tended to have a higher incidence (71%) of point mutations than those with high cellular differentiation (8%). In conclusion, both the overall p53 mutation rate and that a codon 249 in HCC in Hong Kong Chinese are lower than those reported in tumours from China and sub-Saharan Africa. The low mutation rate at codon 249 is compatible with a low aflatoxin exposure. A special type of p53 mutation has not been found to be associated with hepatitis B viral infection. Mutations of p53 gene tends to occur in tumours with low cellular differentiation, suggesting a late occurrence in the event of tumour progression.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Obstructive jaundice in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is uncommon (0.5-13%). Unlike other causes of obstructive jaundice, the role of endoscopic intervention in obstructive jaundice complicated by HCC has not been clearly defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of obstructive jaundice caused by HCC and predictive factors for successful endoscopic intervention. Materials and methods: From 1999 to 2009, 54 patients with HCC who underwent endoscopic intervention to relieve obstructive jaundice were included. We defined endoscopic intervention as a clinical success when the obstructive jaundice was relieved within 4 weeks. Results: Clinical success was achieved in 23 patients (42.6%). Patients in the clinical success group showed better Child-Pugh liver function (C-P grade A or B/C; 17/6 vs. 8/20), lower total bilirubin levels (8.1±5.3 mg/dL vs. 23.1±10.4 mg/dL) prior to the treatment, and no history of alcohol consumption. The only factor predictive of clinical success by multivariate analysis was low total bilirubin level at the time of endoscopic intervention, regardless of history of alcohol consumption [odds ratio 1.223 (95% confidence interval, 1.071-1.396), p=0.003]. The cut-off value of pre-endoscopic treatment total bilirubin level was 12.8 mg/dL for predicting the clinical prognosis. Median survival after endoscopic intervention in the clinical success group was notably longer than that in the clinical failure group (5.6 months vs. 1.5 months, p≤0.001). Conclusion: Before endoscopic intervention, liver function, especially total bilirubin level, should be checked to achieve the best clinical outcome. Endoscopic intervention can be helpful to relieve jaundice in well selected patients with HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The influence of the biological relationship between the donor and the recipient is rarely discussed in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), although it is believed to be an important risk factor in other types of organ transplantations. A total of 272 consecutive patients undergoing adult to adult right lobe LDLT were retrospectively analyzed and stratified into a nonbiologically related (NBR) group (69 patients) and a biologically related (BR) group (203 patients). The preoperative data and postoperative outcomes of both recipients and donors were evaluated.More than two-thirds of the recipients had histories of HBV infection, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the main reason for the patients undergoing LDLT in both groups. The percentage of female donors in the NBR group was more than the percentage in the BR group (P = 0.000). There were no differences between the groups in postoperative laboratory testing or daily immunosuppression dose, and the complication rates in both the recipient and donor surgeries showed no significant differences. For patients with benign diseases, the cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rate were 92.9% in the 4 periods in the NBR group and 89.1%, 87.6%, 83.7%, and 83.7%, respectively, in BR group, while for the patients diagnosed as HCC, if patients exceeding the Milan criteria were involved, the 5-year survival rate was 41.2%, compared to 82% for patients within the Milan criteria, which was nearly the same as for those with the benign disease. In conclusion, our findings suggested that the biological relationship between the donor and the recipient in adult to adult LDLT was not associated with the short- and long-term outcomes of recipients diagnosed with benign liver diseases and early stage HCC. Moreover, the criteria for patients diagnosed with HCC to undergo LDLT should be restrictively selected.",

Aim of the study: Is to establish anthropometric and biochemical specificities in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis diagnosed with non-invasive diagnostic methods. Material and methods: Study enrolled 170 participants, 130 with NASH steatosis. The non-alcoholic group (control), consisted of 40 normal weight patients without metabolic syndrome. Alcohol intake was estimated with established protocol. Routine biochemistry analysis were performed by standard laboratory procedures; serum levels of serum levels of fasting cholesterol and triglycerides, fasting glucose and insulin, insulin resistance estimated by HOMA index (Homeostasis model assessment), biochemistry tests and a liver ultrasound examination. Results: In study participants group, patients were more obese comparing with controls p < 0.01, waist line extent also was of greater statistical significance in the non-alcoholic group fatty liver (p < 0, 01). Comparing biochemical parameter values, significant statistical deference has been noted in glaucosis and insulin levels, total cholesterol and gama-glutamil transferase levels, between groups (p < 0.01). Fasting glucose and insulin levels, HOMA-IR were significantly greater in study cohort group patients, as was significantly positive correlation between BMI and waist line extent. Conclusion: Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver are excessively obese, have greater waist line extent, consequently insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, risk factors known to be associated with the development of cardiovascular disease.",

    "Abstract": "Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), formerly referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis, is an infrequent progressive intrahepatic cholestatic autoimmune illness that can evolve into hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and, in some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma. The disease itself is characterized by T-lymphocyte-mediated chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis and elevated serum levels of extremely specific anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies (AMAs). In this article, we will not only review epidemiology, risk factors, natural history, predictive scores, radiologic approaches (e.g., acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, vibration controlled transient elastography, and magnetic resonance elastography), clinical features, serological characteristics covering biochemical markers, immunoglobulins, infections markers, biomarkers, predictive fibrosis marker, specific antibodies (including AMAs such as AMA-M2), anti-nuclear autoantibodies [such as anti-multiple nuclear dot autoantibodies (anti-sp100, PML, NDP52, anti-sp140), anti-rim-like/membranous anti-nuclear autoantibodies (anti-gp210, anti-p62), anti-centromere autoantibodies, and some of the novel autoantibodies], histopathological characteristics of PBC, diagnostic advances, and anti-diastole of PBC. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the recent advances in research of PBC in terms of therapies, including ursodeoxycholic acid, budesonide, methotrexate, obeticholic acid, cyclosporine A, fibrates such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate, rituximab, mesenchymal stem cells transplant, and hepatic transplant. Currently, hepatic transplant remains the only optimal choice with acknowledged treatment efficiency for end-stage PBC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To provide a clear understanding of viral hepatitis epidemiology and their clinical burdens in Somalia. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive literature search of published studies on viral hepatitis was performed from 1977-2016 in PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, World Health Organization African Index Medicus and the Africa Journals Online databases, as well as on the Ministry of Health website. We also captured unpublished articles that were not available on online systems. Results: Twenty-nine studies from Somalia and Somali immigrants (United Kingdom, United States, Italy, Libya) with a combined sample size for each type of viral hepatitis [hepatitis A virus (HAV): 1564, hepatitis B virus (HBV): 8756, hepatitis C virus (HCV): 6257, hepatitis D virus (HDV): 375 and hepatitis E virus (HEV): 278] were analyzed. The overall pooled prevalence rate of HAV was 90.2% (95%CI: 77.8% to 96%). The HAV prevalence among different age groups was as follows: < 1 year old, 61.54% (95%CI: 40.14% to 79.24%); 1-10 years old, 91.91% (95%CI: 87.76% to 94.73%); 11-19 years old, 96.31% (95%CI: 92.84% to 98.14%); 20-39 years old, 91.3% (95%CI: 83.07% to 95.73%); and > 40 years old, 86.96% (95%CI: 75.68% to 93.47%). The overall pooled prevalence of HBV was 18.9% (95%CI: 14% to 29%). The overall pooled prevalence among subgroups of HBV was 20.5% (95%CI: 5.1% to 55.4%) in pregnant women; 5.7% (95%CI: 2.7% to 11.5%) in children; 39.2% (95%CI: 33.4% to 45.4%) in patients with chronic liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); 7.7% (95%CI: 4.2% to 13.6%), 12.4% (95%CI: 6.3% to 23.0%) and 11.8% (95%CI: 5.3% to 24.5%) in age groups < 20 years old, 20-39 years old and > 40 years old, respectively. The HBV prevalence among risk groups was 20% (95%CI: 7.19% to 44.64%) in female prostitutes, 21.28% (95%CI: 7.15% to 48.69%) in hospitalized adults, 5.56% (95%CI: 0.99% to 25.62%) in hospitalized children, 60% (95%CI: 31.66% to 82.92%) in patients with acute hepatitis, 33.55% (95%CI: 14.44% to 60.16%) in patients with ancylostomiasis, 12.34% (95%CI: 7.24% to 20.26%) in patients with leprosy and 20.19% (95%CI: 11.28% to 33.49%) in schistosomiasis patients. The overall pooled prevalence of HCV was estimated as 4.84% (95%CI: 3.02% to 7.67%). The prevalence rates among blood donors, risk groups, children and patients chronic liver disease (including HCC) was 0.87% (95%CI: 0.33% to 2.30%), 2.43% (95%CI: 1.21% to 4.8%), 1.37% (95%CI: 0.76% to 2.46%) and 29.82% (95%CI: 15.84% to 48.98%), respectively. The prevalence among genotypes of HCV was 21.9% (95%CI: 15.36% to 30.23%) in genotype 1, 0.87% (95%CI: 0.12% to 5.9%) in genotype 2, 25.21% (95%CI: 18.23% to 33.77%) in genotype 3, 46.24% (95%CI: 37.48% to 55.25%) in genotype 4, 2.52% (95%CI: 0.82% to 7.53%) in genotype 5, and 1.19% (95%CI: 0.07% to 16.38%) in genotype 6. The overall pooled prevalence of HDV was 28.99% (95%CI: 16.38% to 45.96%). The HDV prevalence rate among patients with chronic liver disease, including HCC, was 43.77% (95%CI: 35.09% to 52.84%). The overall pooled prevalence of HEV was 46.86% (95%CI: 5.31% to 93.28%). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates a high prevalence of all forms of viral hepatitis in Somalia and it also indicates that chronic HBV was the commonest cause of chronic liver disease. This highlights needs for urgent public health interventions and strategic policy directions to controlling the burden of the disease.",

    "Abstract": "Mounting evidence indicates that deregulation of apoptosis is involved in the mechanisms of cancer development. Mutations of genes encoding caspases, the executioners of apoptosis, have been detected in human cancers, indicating inactivation of apoptosis by the mutations of caspase is an important mechanism in cancer development. The aim of this study was to see whether genes encoding human caspases 1, 4, and 5 are mutated in human cancers. We analyzed the entire coding region and all splice sites of human caspase 1, 4, and 5 genes for the detection of somatic mutations in 337 human cancers, including 103 colorectal, 54 gastric, 60 breast, 60 hepatocellular, and 60 lung carcinomas by a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. We detected 2 (0.6%) caspase-1, 2 (0.6%) caspase-4, and 15 (4.4%) caspase-5 mutations in the 343 cancers. The mutations were detected in 11 gastric carcinomas (2 caspase-1 and 9 caspase-5 mutations), 6 colorectal carcinomas (2 caspase-4 and 4 caspase-5 mutations), 1 breast carcinoma (1 caspase-5 mutation), and 1 lung carcinoma (1 caspase-5 mutation). The mutations consisted of 11 mutations in exons and 8 mutations in noncoding sequences. The 11 mutations in the exons consisted of 3 missense, 1 silent, and 7 frameshift mutation(s). Of note, most (6/9) of the caspase-5 mutations in the coding sequences were detected in microsatellite instability (MSI)-positive cancers. These data indicate that somatic mutations of caspase-1 and caspase-4 genes are rare in common solid cancers. In addition, the data indicate that caspase-5 gene is commonly mutated in the MSI-positive cancers, and suggest that inactivation of caspase-5 may play a role in the tumorigenesis of MSI-positive cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 is a highly infectious pathogen and starts in the respiratory tract and progresses to systemic infection in laboratory mice. The complement system is an important part of the host immune response to viral infection. It is not clear the role of the classical complement pathway in MHV infection. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of the classical pathway in coronavirus pathogenesis by comparing C1qa KO mice and wild-type mice. Methods: We generated a C1qa KO mouse using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and compared the susceptibility to MHV A59 infection between C1qa KO and wild-type mice. Histopathological and immunohistochemical changes, viral loads, and chemokine expressions in both mice were measured. Results: MHV A59-infected C1qa KO mice showed severe histopathological changes, such as hepatocellular necrosis and interstitial pneumonia, compared to MHV A59-infected wild-type mice. Virus copy numbers in the olfactory bulb, liver, and lungs of C1qa KO mice were significantly higher than those of wild-type mice. The increase in viral copy numbers in C1qa KO mice was consistent with the histopathologic changes in organs. These results indicate that C1qa deficiency enhances susceptibility to MHV A59 systemic infection in mice. In addition, this enhanced susceptibility effect is associated with dramatic elevations in spleen IFN-γ, MIP-1 α, and MCP-1 in C1qa KO mice. Conclusions: These data suggest that C1qa deficiency enhances susceptibility to MHV A59 systemic infection, and activation of the classical complement pathway may be important for protecting the host against MHV A59 infection.",

    "Abstract": "MUTYH is a base excision repair enzyme, it plays a crucial role in the correction of DNA errors from guanine oxidation and may be considered a cell protective factor. In humans it is an adenine DNA glycosylase that removes adenine misincorporated in 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) pairs, inducing G:C to T:A transversions. MUTYH functionally cooperates with OGG1 that eliminates 8-oxodG derived from excessive reactive oxygen species production. MUTYH mutations have been linked to MUTYH associated polyposis syndrome (MAP), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas. MAP patients show a greatly increased lifetime risk for gastrointestinal cancers. The cancer risk in mono-allelic carriers associated with one MUTYH mutant allele is controversial and it remains to be clarified whether the altered functions of this protein may have a pathophysiological involvement in other diseases besides familial gastrointestinal diseases. This review evaluates the role of MUTYH, focusing on current studies of human neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases different to colon polyposis and colorectal cancer. This will provide novel insights into the understanding of the molecular basis underlying MUTYH-related pathogenesis. Furthermore, we describe the association between MUTYH single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and different cancer and non-cancer diseases. We address the utility to increase our knowledge regarding MUTYH in the light of recent advances in the literature with the aim of a better understanding of the potential for identifying new therapeutic targets. Considering the multiple functions and interactions of MUTYH protein, its involvement in pathologies based on oxidative stress damage could be hypothesized. Although the development of extraintestinal cancer in MUTYH heterozygotes is not completely defined, the risk for malignancies of the duodenum, ovary, and bladder is also increased as well as the onset of benign and malignant endocrine tumors. The presence of MUTYH pathogenic variants is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in sporadic gastric cancer and in salivary gland secretory carcinoma, while its inhibition has been shown to reduce the survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, some MUTYH SNPs have been associated with lung, hepatocellular and cervical cancer risk. An additional role of MUTYH seems to contribute to the prevention of numerous other disorders with an inflammatory/degenerative basis, including neurological and ocular diseases. Finally, it is interesting to note that MUTYH could be a new therapeutic target and future studies will shed light on its specific functions in the prevention of diseases and in the improvement of the chemo-sensitivity of cancer cells.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of p53 and Ki-ras exon 1 were investigated in rat hepatic lesions induced by four kinds of hepatocarcinogenic protocols: continuous feeding of 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB), daily intraperitoneal injection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), and the Solt and Farber regimen (Nature 236:701-703, 1976), in which diethylnitrosamine (DEN) or nitrosomethylurea (NMU) was used as initiating agents. DNA from microdissected tissue sections was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directly using primers for p53 exons 5-8 and Ki-ras exon 1 and analyzed for mutations by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) or constant denaturant gel electrophoresis (CDGE). One or both of the p53 PCR primers were located within introns to prevent amplifying the p53 processed pseudogenes. In a total of 59 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), no p53 aberrations were detected, indicating that p53 mutations are not very important in rat hepatic carcinogenesis. On the other hand, Ki-ras codon 12 mutations were found at low frequency in HCCs, hyperplastic foci, and cholangiofibroses induced by 3'-Me-DAB and by AFB1 but not in the lesions induced by the Solt and Farber regimen. Although Ki-ras codon 12 mutations are generally infrequent in rat hepatic tumors, their incidence thus appears to vary depending on the carcinogen used for their induction.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of p53 mutations in European hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods: DNA extracts from 20 microdissected tumor samples were investigated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of subcloned polymerase chain reaction-fragments of the conserved domain exons 5-8 was performed in order to detect heterogeneous distribution of p53 mutated cells within the tumors. In a screening procedure four clones of each exon 5-8 were analyzed. To confirm the observed mutations polymerase chain reaction and subcloning was repeated. Results: Sequence analysis confirmed a mutation in only two cases (10%). One at codon 220 (exon 6) was a homogeneous transition in nearly all clones from TAT to TGT. The other mutation was a transition from cGG to CAG at the known hot spot codon 248 (exon 7). It was found in 30% of the clones. We conclude that the other mutations from the first step were artefacts due to the infidelity of the taq-polymerase. All tumors had wild type sequence at the reported hot spot codon 249. The minor importance of p53 gene alterations in European hepatocarcinogenesis was further confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. Only the tumors with the heterogeneous p53 mutation at codon 248 showed a p53 overexpression in nearly 30% of the nuclei. None of the other tumors showed higher levels of p53 expression. Conclusions: We therefore conclude that the incidence of p53 mutations in European hepatocellular carcinomas is very low. Generally there may be no heterogeneous distribution of p53 mutated cells within a tumor. The contribution of this genetic alteration to hepatocarcinogenesis in Europe seems of little importance.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of liver-related mortality. Serum pentraxin 3 (PTX3) has been revealed to be associated with the development of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. This study evaluated whether serum PTX3 is related to the survival of HBV-related HCC patients. Methods: One hundred and seven patients with HBV-related HCC were included. Baseline serum PTX3 levels were quantified using quantitative immunoassay. The HCC patients were followed-up for a median of 24 months and divided into high serum PTX3 level and low PTX3 level groups according to the baseline serum PTX3 levels. The overall survivals of the HBV-related HCC patients according to the serum PTX3 levels were compared. Factors potentially influencing the prognosis of the patients with HBV-related HCC were analyzed. Results: HCC patients with high serum PTX3 levels [PTX3 > 9.25ng/mL (n=85)] had a shorter overall survival time than HCC patients with low serum PTX3 levels [PTX3 ≤ 9.25ng/mL (n=22)] (P = 0.049). HCC patients with serum PTX3 levels between >9.25ng/mL and ≤9.25ng/mL had significant difference in HCC histology grade. Multivariate analysis showed that PTX3 level was an independent risk factor related to the overall survival of HCC patients (hazard ratio: 1.058, 95% confidence interval: 1.031-1.085, P <0.001). Conclusion: These results support the involvement of PTX3 in the disease progression of HCC and suggest the potential of using serum PTX3 levels as a biomarker for the prognostic prediction of HBV-related HCC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Numerous studies have linked the proliferation of liver progenitor cells (LPCs) during chronic liver disease to the risk for development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, selective inhibition of LPC growth during preneoplastic injury may prevent or delay the onset of liver cancer. Rats carrying a germ-line mutation in c-kit have an impaired LPC response to liver injury. Therefore, we hypothesized that the c-kit inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) would suppress LPC growth and, therefore, may exert antitumorigenic effects in the liver. Methods: Expression of IM target proteins was examined in chronically injured rodent and human livers. The effect of IM was examined in vitro using LPC lines and in vivo in mice fed a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet. Livers were examined following short-term (up to 1 month) or long-term (up to 14 months) feeding of CDE diet and drug treatments. Results: C-kit was significantly up-regulated in chronic injury and expressed by LPCs. IM was antiproliferative to LPC lines, and knockdown of c-kit reduced this response. IM treatment inhibited the LPCs response and early fibrogenesis induced by a short-term CDE diet. On the longer term, IM treatment reduced the extent of fibrosis and significantly inhibited tumor formation. Conclusions: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as IM, may be suited for the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of chronic liver injury via antiproliferative effects on c-kit-expressing LPCs.",

    "Abstract": "Lessons learned: The combination of ramucirumab (8 mg/kg intravenous, day 1 every 2 weeks) and FOLFOX4 as first-line treatment in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not sufficiently tolerated. Preliminary efficacy data suggest that the combination may provide clinical benefit to patients with HCC. Dose modification and patient selection should be considered for the future development of ramucirumab plus FOLFOX chemotherapy for advanced HCC. Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of ramucirumab plus FOLFOX4 as first-line treatment in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Patients received ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) intravenously (IV) on day 1, followed by FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV on day 1, folinic acid 200 mg/m2 IV, bolus fluorouracil [5-FU] 400 mg/m2 , and a continuous infusion of 5-FU 600 mg/m2 over 22 hours, on days 1 and 2) every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. Results: Eight patients (6 men, 2 women) were treated; all eight patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of grade ≥3. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in three patients (37.5%): hepatic hemorrhage (grade 4), blood bilirubin increased (grade 3), and febrile neutropenia (grade 3). Two patients discontinued study because of hepatic hemorrhage (grade 4) and blood bilirubin increase (grade 3). Six deaths occurred due to progressive disease, and no deaths due to TEAEs. Conclusion: There were no unexpected safety findings with ramucirumab plus FOLFOX4 based on the known safety and toxicity of this regimen. The combination was not sufficiently tolerated in patients with advanced HCC at the specified dose and schedule.",

    "Abstract": "Malignant transformation of fibrous dysplasia lesions has been reported in patients with fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS). Recently, we have observed an increased risk for breast cancer. In this study, the prevalence of skeletal and extraskeletal malignancies in patients with FD/MAS in the Netherlands was assessed by analyzing data from our cohort of FD/MAS patients, the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA), and the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). We extracted data on sex, age at diagnosis of FD/MAS, type of FD/MAS, type of malignancy, and age at diagnosis of malignancy and histology of bone and malignant tissue when available, including GNAS-mutation analysis from patients' medical records. Standardized Morbidity Ratios (SMRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Twelve malignancies were identified in the LUMC FD/MAS cohort and 100 in the PALGA cohort. In this cohort, SMR was increased for osteosarcoma (19.7, 95% CI 3.5-48.9), cervical cancer (4.93, 95%CI 1.7-8.2), thyroid cancer (3.71, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), prostate cancer (3.08, 95% CI 1.8-4.6), and melanoma (2.01, 95%CI 1.2-3.1). SMRs for pancreatic cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma could not be calculated due to low numbers. The small number of malignancies identified in our FD/MAS cohort precluded the calculation of SMRs for our cohort specifically. Our findings show that patients with FD/MAS appear to have an increased risk for osteosarcoma, cervical, thyroid, and prostate cancer and melanoma. However, these data should be interpreted with caution, as true incidence rates of the identified malignancies may be influenced by the inclusion of only patients with histologically confirmed FD/MAS. The etiology of this increased risk for malignancies still needs to be elucidated.",

    "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in industrialized countries and may proceed to steatohepatitis (NASH). Apoptosis and free fatty acid (FFA)-induced lipotoxicity are important features of NASH pathogenesis. We have shown a hepatoprotective effect of adiponectin in steatotic livers of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients and recent data links bile acid (BA) metabolism to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The aim of this study was to identify potential interactions between BA and FFA metabolism in NAFLD. Liver biopsies and serum samples from 113 morbidly obese patients receiving bariatric surgery, healthy individuals, and moderately obese NAFLD patients were studied. Serum FFA, BA, and M30 were increased in NASH versus simple steatosis, while adiponectin was significantly decreased. The NAFLD activity score (NAS) score correlated with BA levels and reversely with adiponectin. Adiponectin reversely correlated with CD95/Fas messenger RNA (mRNA) and hepatocellular apoptosis. The BA transporter high-affinity Na+ /taurocholate cotransporter (NTCP) and the BA synthesizing enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) were significantly up-regulated in obese patients and hepatoma cells exposed to FFA. Up-regulation of NTCP and CYP7A1 indicate failure to activate small heterodimer partner (SHP) upon farnesoid X receptor (FXR) stimulation by increasing BA concentrations. In line with the NAS score, adiponectin levels were reversely correlated with BA levels. Adiponectin correlated with NTCP and affects Cyp7A1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Conclusion: BA synthesis and serum BA levels correlated with disease severity in NAFLD, while adiponectin is reversely correlated. FFA exposure prevented SHP-mediated repression of NTCP and Cyp7A1 expression, which lead to increased BA synthesis and uptake. In NASH, BA accumulation induced hepatocyte cell death and late FXR activation failed to prevent hepatocyte injury due to decreased adiponectin levels. Early treatment with FXR ligands and/or adiponectin-receptor agonists might prevent NASH.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To determine the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the impact of HCC surveillance on early diagnosis and survival of cirrhotic outpatients. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, cirrhotic outpatients undergoing HCC surveillance between March 2005 and March 2014 were analyzed. Exclusion criteria were HIV coinfection; previous organ transplantation; diagnosis of HCC at first consultation; missing data in the medical chart; and less than 1 year of follow-up. Surveillance was carried out every six months using ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein determination. Ten-year cumulative incidence and survival were estimated through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Four hundred and fifty-three patients were enrolled, of which 57.6% were male. Mean age was 55 years. Hepatitis C virus and heavy use of alcohol were the main etiologic agents of cirrhosis. HCC was diagnosed in 75 patients (16.6%), with an estimated cumulative incidence of 2.6% in the 1st year, 15.4% in the 5th year, and 28.8% in the 10th year. Median survival was estimated at 17.6 mo in HCC patients compared to 234 mo in non-HCC patients (P < 0.001). Early-stage HCC was more often detected in patients who underwent surveillance every 6 mo or less (P = 0.05). However, survival was not different between patients with early stage vs non-early stage tumors [HR = 0.54 (0.15-1.89), P = 0.33]. Conclusion: HCC is a frequent complication in patients with cirrhosis and adherence to surveillance programs favors early diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "The numerous functions of the liver are controlled primarily at the transcriptional level by the concerted actions of a limited number of hepatocyte-enriched transcription factors (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha [HNF1alpha], -1beta, -3alpha, -3beta, -3gamma, -4alpha, and -6 and members of the c/ebp family). Of these, only HNF4alpha (nuclear receptor 2A1) and HNF1alpha appear to be correlated with the differentiated phenotype of cultured hepatoma cells. HNF1alpha-null mice are viable, indicating that this factor is not an absolute requirement for the formation of an active hepatic parenchyma. In contrast, HNF4alpha-null mice die during embryogenesis. Moreover, recent in vitro experiments using tetraploid aggregation suggest that HNF4alpha is indispensable for hepatocyte differentiation. However, the function of HNF4alpha in the maintenance of hepatocyte differentiation and function is less well understood. To address the function of HNF4alpha in the mature hepatocyte, a conditional gene knockout was produced using the Cre-loxP system. Mice lacking hepatic HNF4alpha expression accumulated lipid in the liver and exhibited greatly reduced serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increased serum bile acid concentrations. The observed phenotypes may be explained by (i) a selective disruption of very-low-density lipoprotein secretion due to decreased expression of genes encoding apolipoprotein B and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, (ii) an increase in hepatic cholesterol uptake due to increased expression of the major high-density lipoprotein receptor, scavenger receptor BI, and (iii) a decrease in bile acid uptake to the liver due to down-regulation of the major basolateral bile acid transporters sodium taurocholate cotransporter protein and organic anion transporter protein 1. These data indicate that HNF4alpha is central to the maintenance of hepatocyte differentiation and is a major in vivo regulator of genes involved in the control of lipid homeostasis.",

    "Abstract": "von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a pleomorphic familial tumor syndrome that is characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors. Homozygous disruption of the VHL gene in mice results in embryonic lethality. To investigate VHL function in the adult we have generated a conditional VHL null allele (2-lox allele) and null allele (1-lox allele) by Cre-mediated recombination in embryonic stem cells. We show here that mice heterozygous for the 1-lox allele develop cavernous hemangiomas of the liver, a rare manifestation of the human disease. Histologically these tumors were associated with hepatocellular steatosis and focal proliferations of small vessels. To study the cellular origin of these lesions we inactivated VHL tissue-specifically in hepatocytes. Deletion of VHL in the liver resulted in severe steatosis, many blood-filled vascular cavities, and foci of increased vascularization within the hepatic parenchyma. These histopathological changes were similar to those seen in livers from mice heterozygous for the 1-lox allele. Hypoxia-inducible mRNAs encoding vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 1, and erythropoietin were up-regulated. We thus provide evidence that targeted inactivation of mouse VHL can model clinical features of the human disease and underline the importance of the VHL gene product in the regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes in vivo.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic ethanol consumption can cause sustained hepatocellular injury and inhibit the subsequent regenerative response. These effects of ethanol may be mediated by impaired hepatocyte survival mechanisms. The present study examines the effects of ethanol on survival signaling in the intact liver. Adult Long Evans rats were maintained on ethanol-containing or isocaloric control liquid diets for 8 weeks, after which the livers were harvested to measure mRNA levels, protein expression, and kinase or phosphatase activity related to survival or proapoptosis mechanisms. Chronic ethanol exposure resulted in increased hepatocellular labeling for activated caspase 3 and nuclear DNA damage as demonstrated using the TUNEL assay. These effects of ethanol were associated with reduced levels of tyrosyl phosphorylated (PY) IRS-1 and PI3 kinase, Akt kinase, and Erk MAPK activities and increased levels of phosphatase tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) mRNA, protein, and phosphatase activity in liver tissue. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ethanol increases PTEN expression and function in hepatocytes. However, analysis of signaling cascade pertinent to PTEN function revealed increased levels of nuclear p53 and Fas receptor mRNA but without corresponding increases in GSK-3 activity or activated BAD. Although fork-head transcription factor levels were increased in ethanol-exposed livers, virtually all of the fork-head protein detected by Western blot analysis was localized within the cytosolic fraction. In conclusion, chronic ethanol exposure impairs survival mechanisms in the liver because of inhibition of signaling through PI3 kinase and Akt and increased levels of PTEN. However, uncoupling of the signaling cascade downstream of PTEN that mediates apoptosis may account for the relatively modest degrees of ongoing cell loss observed in livers of chronic ethanol-fed rats.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Needle track seeding in the local treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not yet evaluated for catheter-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT), a novel local ablative technique. Material and methods: We report a retrospective analysis of 100 patients treated on 233 HCC lesions by HDR-BT (using 588 catheters in total). No needle or catheter track irradiation was used. Minimum required follow-up with imaging was 6 months. In case of suspected needle track seeding (intra- and/or extrahepatic) in follow-up, image fusion of follow-up CT/MRI with 3D irradiation plan was used to verify the location of a new tumor deposit within the path of a brachytherapy catheter at the time of treatment. Results: We identified 9 needle track metastases, corresponding to a catheter-based risk of 1.5% for any location of occurrence. A total of 7 metastases were located within the liver (catheter-based risk, 1.2%), and 2 metastases were located extrahepatic (catheter-based risk, 0.3%). Eight out of 9 needle track metastases were successfully treated by further HDR-BT. Conclusions: The risk for needle track seeding after interstitial HDR-BT of HCC is comparable to previous reports of percutaneous biopsies and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), especially in case of extrahepatic needle track metastases. To compensate for the risk of seeding, a track irradiation technique similar to track ablation in RFA should be implemented in clinical routine.",

Methods: Forty male nude mice were randomly divided into 4 groups. Human HCC tissue was implanted in the livers of three groups. After 24 h, the three groups were treated respectively with JPJDF (37.5 g/kg), saline (20 mL/kg) and Tegafur (FT-207, 160 mg/kg) once a day for 10 weeks. The control group without implanting the tissue was concurrently treated with saline (20 mL/kg). The survival data and body weight of all mice were recorded, and expression levels of PTEN, PI3K and FAK in normal tissue and cancer tissue of the livers were evaluated with immunohistochemical method. Results: The cumulative survival rate of the mice in the JPJDF group was higher than those of the other groups. The rate of weight loss was the lowest in JPJDF group. The survivability and weight loss rate in FT-207 group were the poorest in all groups. The expression intensity of PTEN was higher in normal tissues than in cancer tissues, and lower in the normal tissues of HCC models than in that of mice without HCC. The PTEN expression intensity in normal tissue and cancer tissue from mice treated with FT-207 were lower than that from the mice treated with JPJDF or saline. The expression intensity of PI3K was higher in cancer tissue than in normal tissue. The PI3K expression intensity was the lowest in normal tissue and cancer tissue from mice treated with JPJDF, and the intensity from mice treated with FT-207 was the highest. In mice treated with JPJDF, the expression intensity of FAK was higher in the normal tissue and lower in the cancer tissue than those of the other treatment groups. Conclusion: The mechanism accounting for the prolonged survival of HCC-bearing mice treated with JPJDF might be related to the reduction in weight loss and the benign regulation of PTEN, PI3K, and FAK.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prognoses of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative hepatectomy remain unsatisfactory because of the high incidence of postoperative recurrence. Published predictive systems focus on pre-resection oncological characteristics, ignoring post-recurrence factors. Purpose: This study aimed to develop prognostic nomograms for 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) of patients with HCC after curative hepatectomy, focusing on potentially influential post-recurrence factors. Patients and methods: Clinicopathological and postoperative follow-up data were extracted from 494 patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy between January 2012 and June 2019. Early recurrence (ER) and late recurrence (LR) were defined as recurrence at ≤2 and >2 years, respectively, after curative hepatectomy. Nomograms for the prediction of 3- and 5-year OS were established based on multivariate analysis. The areas under time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for the nomograms were calculated independently to verify predictive accuracy. The nomograms were internally validated based on 2000 bootstrap resampling of 75% of the original data. Results: In total, 494 patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy met the eligibility criteria. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified factors potentially influencing 3- and 5-year OS. Multivariate analysis indicated that patient age, Hong Kong Liver Cancer stage, γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GGT) level, METAVIR inflammation activity grade, ER and post-recurrence treatment modality were influencing factors for 3-year OS (AUC, 0.891; 95% CI, 0.8364-0.9447). γ-GGT > 60 U/L, hepatectomy extent, LR and post-recurrence treatment modality were influencing factors for 5-year OS (AUC, 0.864; 95% CI, 0.8041-0.9237). Calibration plots showed satisfactory concordance between the predicted and actual observation cohorts. Conclusion: We propose new prognostic nomograms for OS prediction with a focus on the differentiation of recurrence timing and post-recurrence management. These nomograms overcome the shortcomings of previous predictive nomograms and significantly improve predictive accuracy.",

Polycythemia has been observed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying molecular basis remains unknown. Liver tissues from 302 HCC patients, including 104 with polycythemia, were sequenced for HIF2A mutations. A germline HIF2A mutation was detected in one HCC patient with concurrent polycythemia. Three additional family members carried this mutation, but none exhibited polycythemia or were diagnosed with HCC. The gain-of-function mutation resulted in a HIF-2α protein that was transcribed normally but resistant to degradation. HIF-2α target genes EDN1, EPO, GNA14, and VEGF were significantly upregulated in the tumor bed but not in the surrounding liver tissue. Polycythemia resolved upon total resection of the tumor tissue. This newly described HIF2A mutation may promote HCC oncogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "PTEN and p53 are highly mutated in many cancers. These two tumor suppressors have critical functions in the nucleus, such as DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and genome maintenance. However, the in vivo functional relationship of nuclear PTEN and p53 is unknown. Here, we analyzed the liver of mice in which nuclear PTEN and p53 are individually or simultaneously depleted. We found that nuclear PTEN loss greatly upregulates p53 expression upon oxidative stress, while the loss of p53 potentiates stress-induced accumulation of PTEN in the nucleus. Next, we examined oxidative stress-induced DNA damage in hepatocytes, and found that nuclear PTEN loss aggravated the damage while p53 loss did not. Notably, mice lacking nuclear PTEN had increased hepatocellular carcinoma under oxidative stress, while mice lacking p53 in hepatocytes had accelerated hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The formation of cholangiocarcinoma appears to involve the transformation of hepatocytes into cholangiocarcinoma. Simultaneous loss of nuclear PTEN and p53 exacerbated both types of liver cancers. These data suggest that nuclear PTEN and p53 suppress liver cancers through distinct mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Microsatellite instability occurs frequently in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma, in sporadic gastrointestinal carcinoma, and in other tumors. In these tumors, slippage-related frameshift mutations have been detected at coding mononucleotide repeats in genes such as those for transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II (TGFbetaRII), mannose 6-phosphate/insulinlike growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGFIIR), hMSH3, hMSH6, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). Because these genes regulate cell growth or repair DNA mismatches, loss of their function is thought to promote tumor development. The authors screened for these frameshift mutations and investigated the incidence of microsatellite instability (MI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan. Methods: Fifty HCC samples were analyzed in this study. The authors used polymerase chain reactions to screen for frameshift mutation at the TGFbetaRII (A)(10) tract, the M6P/IGFIIR (G)(8) tract, the hMSH3 (A)(8) tract, the hMSH6 (C)(8) tract, and the BAX (G)(8) tract. For MI analysis, matched tumor and nontumor liver DNA were investigated with respect to 10 microsatellite loci. Results: No frameshift mutation was detected in any case, and only 4% of these cancers exhibited MI in comparisons between tumor and nontumor liver specimens. Conclusions: This study suggests that frameshift mutation at coding mononucleotide repeats within TGFbetaRII, M6P/IGFIIR, hMSH3, hMSH6, and BAX genes did not seem to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis in the Japanese population studied.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Tzukuan, located in the southwestern area of Taiwan, is an HCV hyperendemic area (>30%). This study aimed to assess the changing epidemiological characteristics of HCV infection and to evaluate the long-term outcomes after the implementation of public health strategies for two decades. Design: A population-based retrospective cohort study. Setting: A comprehensive care programme was implemented, namely COMPACT Study, in Tzukuan since 1997. Participants: A total of 10 714 residents participated the screening. Outcome measures: The HCV status, demographic and clinical profiles of the participants were recorded and validated annually from 2000 through 2019. Results: The HCV infection prevalence rates were 21.1% (1076/5099) in 2000-2004, 18.8% (239/1269) in 2005-2009, 14.1% (292/2071) in 2010-2014 and 10.3% (234/2275) in 2015-2019 (p for trend test <0.0001). Among them, 1614 underwent repeated tests during the follow-up period. The annual incidence rates were 0.54% in 2005-2009, 0.4% in 2010-2014 and 0.22% in 2015-2019, respectively (p=0.01). In addition to old age, lower education level was a major risk factor for HCV infection across different periods. HCV infection prevalence rate among those illiterates reached 40.9%, followed by 28.5% in those with elementary school level, and <10% in those with high school or higher levels. The major risk factor has shifted from iatrogenic exposure in 2000-2009 to household transmission after 2010. Conclusions: HCV infection has been decreasing and the epidemiological features are changing in the hyperendemic area by continuing education, prevention and treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancers (CRCs) that lack DNA mismatch repair function exhibit the microsatellite unstable (MSI) phenotype and are characterized by the accumulation of frameshift mutations at short repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellites). These tumors recurrently show inactivating frameshift mutations in the tumor suppressor Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor Type 2 (TGFBR2) thereby abrogating downstream signaling. How altered TGFBR2 signaling affects exosome-mediated communication between MSI tumor cells and their environment has not been resolved. Here, we report on molecular alterations of exosomes shed by MSI cells and the biological response evoked in recipient cells. Methods: Exosomes were isolated and characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking, and western blot analysis. TGFBR2-dependent effects on the cargo and functions of exosomes were studied in a MSI CRC model cell line enabling reconstituted and inducible TGFBR2 expression and signaling. Microsatellite frameshift mutations in exosomal and cellular DNA were examined by PCR-based DNA fragment analysis and exosomal protein profiles were identified by mass spectrometry. Uptake of fluorescent-labeled exosomes by hepatoma recipient cells was monitored by confocal microscopy. TGFBR2-dependent exosomal effects on secreted cytokine levels of recipient cells were analyzed by Luminex technology and ELISA. Results: Frameshift mutation patterns in microsatellite stretches of TGFBR2 and other MSI target genes were found to be reflected in the cargo of MSI CRC-derived exosomes. At the proteome level, reconstituted TGFBR2 expression and signaling uncovered two protein subsets exclusively occurring in exosomes derived from TGFBR2-deficient (14 proteins) or TGFBR2-proficient (five proteins) MSI donor cells. Uptake of these exosomes by recipient cells caused increased secretion (2-6 fold) of specific cytokines (Interleukin-4, Stem Cell Factor, Platelet-derived Growth Factor-B), depending on the TGFBR2 expression status of the tumor cell. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the coding MSI phenotype of DNA mismatch repair-deficient CRC cells is maintained in their exosomal DNA. Moreover, we uncovered that a recurrent MSI tumor driver mutation like TGFBR2 can reprogram the protein content of MSI cell-derived exosomes and in turn modulate the cytokine secretion profile of recipient cells. Apart from its diagnostic potential, these TGFBR2-dependent exosomal molecular and proteomic signatures might help to understand the signaling routes used by MSI tumors. Fricke et al. uncovered coding microsatellite instability-associated mutations of colorectal tumor driver genes like TGFBR2 in MSI tumor cellderived exosomes. Depending on the TGFBR2 expression status of their donor cells, shed exosomes show distinct proteomic signatures and promote altered cytokine secretion profiles in recipient cells.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND The main cause of death in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal hypertension is esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding caused by severe portal hypertension; therefore, the treatment of portal hypertension is particularly important to prolong the survival of patients. The therapeutic efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for HCC with esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding has been rarely reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical efficacy of TIPS combined with TACE in the treatment of HCC with esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 80 patients with HCC with esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding from July 2015 to November 2019 were retrospectively investigated. Clinical outcomes, biochemical indexes, and complications were compared between TIPS plus TACE and endoscopy plus TACE treatments. RESULTS Gastrointestinal rebleeding and adverse reactions (P<0.05) after TIPS combined with TACE were lower than that after endoscopy combined with TACE treatment. Furthermore, TIPS plus TACE had superior clinical outcomes than endoscopy plus TACE, which was associated with promising progression-free survival, overall survival, objective response rate, and disease control rate, and improved liver function. CONCLUSIONS TIPS combined with TACE was better than endoscopy combined with TACE in the treatment of patients with HCC and esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding. TIPS combined with TACE had a better therapeutic effect on improving liver function and prolonging patient survival time.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Gadoxetate sodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is taken into hepatocytes and excreted into the bile. Hepatocytes with reduced function or dysfunction due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis or hepatic fibrosis show impaired Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake. The purpose of the present retrospective case series was to assess the relationship between liver function and contrast enhancement using Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI. Methods: Sixteen dogs with a histopathological diagnosis of liver disease, including six with HCC, three with nodular hyperplasia, two with hepatocellular adenoma, two with liver fibrosis and three with hepatitis were included in the study along with three dogs with suspected liver disease but no histopathological diagnosis of liver disease. Relative signal intensities (RSI) of the common bile duct and gall bladder were calculated, and their relationship with the following serum biochemical parameters was assessed: total bilirubin, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and albumin (Alb). To assess anatomical liver function, relative contrast enhancement indices (RCEI) of the liver were calculated, and differences were assessed between normal and diseased liver. Results: RSI showed no significant differences between dogs without and with a histopathological diagnosis of liver disease (P=0.88) although they were significantly correlated with Alb (ρ=0.57, P=0.02) in dogs with a histopathological diagnosis of liver disease. RCEI was significantly higher in normal liver tissue than that in livers with hepatitis/fibrosis (P=0.048) and HCC (P=0.03) but not nodular hyperplasia/hepatocellular adenoma (P=0.51). Conclusions: Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI may be potentially useful in the assessment of anatomical liver function in dogs with liver disease.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance is regarded as the ideal endpoint for antiviral treatment. However, reports on the durability of and outcomes after HBsAg seroclearance are few, which has become a focus in clinical practice. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the durability and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence after HBsAg seroclearance after treatment cessation. We searched PubMed, Embase, Medline and Web of Science for studies that reported the durability and HCC incidence after HBsAg seroclearance published between 1 January 2000 and 31 January 2020. Data were analysed by a random-effects model. Thirty-eight studies and 43,924 patients were finally included. The results showed that HBsAg seroclearance was durable, with a pooled recurrence rate of 6.19% (95% CI: 4.10%-8.68%). There was no significant difference in recurrence rates after different seroclearance methods or among recurrence types and different regions. Anti-HBs seroconversion resulted in a significantly reduced recurrence rate (RR = 0.25, p < .001). Patients who experienced HBsAg seroclearance had significantly lower HCC incidence than HBsAg-positive (RR = 0.41, p < .001). The pooled HCC incidence after HBsAg seroclearance was 1.88%; this rate was reduced to 0.76% among patients without baseline cirrhosis. In conclusion, the analysis during an average follow-up of 4.74 years suggested that in patients who experienced sustained HBsAg seroclearance and anti-HBs seroconversion, this was associated with low HCC incidence. Patients without baseline cirrhosis benefited even more. We emphasize the importance of gaining HBsAg seroclearance while highlighting the benefits of achieving this as early as possible.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To test the hypothesis that a greater proportion of physician time on primary care teams are associated with decreased emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and readmissions, and to determine clinician and care team characteristics associated with greater utilization. Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed administrative data collected from January 1 to December 31, 2017, of 420 family medicine clinicians (253 physicians, 167 nurse practitioners/physician assistants [NP/PAs]) with patient panels in an integrated health system in 59 Midwestern communities serving rural and urban areas in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa. These clinicians cared for 419,581 patients through 110 care teams, with varying numbers of physicians and NP/PAs. Primary outcome measures were rates of ED visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions. Results: The proportion of physician full-time equivalents on the team was unrelated to rates of ED visits (rate ratio [RR] = 0.826; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.624 to 1.063), hospitalizations (RR = 0.894; 95% CI, 0.746 to 1.072), or readmissions (RR = -0.026; 95% CI, 0.364 to 0.312). In separate multivariable models adjusted for clinician and practice-level characteristics, the rate of ED visits was positively associated with mean panel hierarchical condition category (HCC) score, urban vs rural setting, NP/PA vs physician, and lower years in practice. The rate of inpatient admissions was associated with HCC score, and 30-day hospital readmissions were positively associated with HCC score, lower years in practice, and male clinicians. Conclusion: Care team physician and NP/PA composition was not independently related to utilization. More complex panels had higher rates of ED visits, hospitalization, and readmissions. Statistically significant differences between physician and NP/PA panels were only evident for ED visits.",

    "Abstract": "Liver function is a major prognostic factor following hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is well correlated with the degree of fibrosis. On the other hand, the presence of liver cirrhosis itself leads to a higher incidence of HCC than chronic hepatitis. Therefore, preoperative noninvasive markers of fibrosis are important for the assessment of prognosis for treatment of HCC. The present study aimed to analyze whether aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) could predict prognosis following hepatic resection for HCC. The subjects were 162 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC between January 2000 and December 2011. The relationship between APRI and disease-free and overall survival were retrospectively investigated. In multivariate analysis, indocyanine green at 15 min (ICG-R15) ≥15% (P=0.0306), APRI ≥0.45 (P=0.0184), perioperative blood transfusion of red cell concentrates (RCC; P=0.0034) and TNM stage II, III or IV (P=0.0184) were significant predictors in disease-free survival. For overall survival, ICG-R15 ≥15% (P=0.0454), APRI ≥0.45 (P=0.0417), perioperative blood transfusion of RCC (P=0.0036) and TNM stage II, III or IV (P=0.0033) were significant predictors. In addition, higher APRI values were positively correlated with hepatitis C virus infection and preoperative liver function. In conclusion, APRI is an independent risk factor for disease-free and overall survival following hepatic resection for HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To compare overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between microwave ablation (MWA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) smaller than 5 cm. Methods: Patients with solitary HCC smaller than 5cm who initially underwent MWA or TACE were identified in Chinese PLA General Hospital from June 2010 to October 2015. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed with a 1:1 matching protocol. OS and PFS were compared by using the log-rank test. After matching, subgroup analysis based on tumor size (≤3cm/3.1-5cm) was also conducted. Prognostic factors for OS and PFS were assessed with Cox proportional hazard regression model. Results: A total of 202 patients (MWA, n=120; TACE, n=82) were identified. After matching, 116 patients were included (58 patients for each treatment group). MWA provided significantly better OS and PFS than TACE for both the entire cohort (OS, P<0.001; PFS, P<0.001) and the matched cohort (OS, P=0.015; PFS, P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that among patients with tumor of 3cm or less, the MWA group had significantly better OS (P=0.027) and PFS (P=0.008) than the TACE group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed TACE was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio, 2.385; 95% CI: 1.427, 3.985; P=0.001) and PFS (hazard ratio, 2.567; 95% CI: 1.820, 3.622; P<0.001). Conclusion: MWA outperformed TACE for solitary HCC smaller than 5cm in OS and PFS. For single tumors less than 5cm, especially those smaller ones (≤3cm), priority should be given to MWA when making treatment options between MWA and TACE.",

The degree of hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients with HCC negatively impacts their health, and the risk of liver failure is always present. In these cases, liver transplantation may be necessary as a rescue procedure. We present the case of a patient with HCC who underwent ALPPS and developed liver failure. A living donor liver transplant was performed as a rescue procedure. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis underwent computed tomography, which revealed an expansive lesion in the right lobe of his liver that was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver resection was indicated and liver cirrhosis was observed with high portal pressure after transection. The treatment strategy was switched from right hepatectomy to ALPPS. The patient developed severe liver dysfunction and liver transplantation was indicated. His postoperative course was uneventful and 3 months after the procedure the patient was without complications. CONCLUSIONS Living donor liver transplantation may be necessary as a rescue procedure for patients who underwent ALPPS and develop liver dysfunction.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Oncocytic carcinomas (Hürthle cell carcinomas [HCCs]) are commonly considered a subgroup of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs). Recent characterization of a subgroup of \"Hürthle cell\" papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) was based on the identification of PTC-specific RET hybrid oncogenes in HCCs. Methods: We examined 27 HCCs, 4 oxyphilic FTCs, 5 oxyphilic PTCs, 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas arising from HCCs (HCC-UTCs), and 16 oxyphilic adenomas. Total RNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded thyroid neoplasms by a novel macrodissection technique that uses a cylindric punch. After reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-based screening for RET rearrangements, the samples were tested for all known RET/PTC 1 to 11 hybrids with the use of artificially constructed chimeric sequences as controls. Results: The elimination of C cells by punching dissection significantly reduced RET wild-type expression. RET hybrid oncogenes (7x RET/PTC1, 1x RET/PTC1L, 2x RET/PTC3, 5 uncharacterized RET/PTCx) were demonstrated in 7 of 27 HCCs, in 0 of 4 oxyphilic FTCs, in 4 of 5 oxyphilic PTCs, in 1 of 2 HCC-UTCs, and in 3 of 16 oxyphilic adenomas. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the expression of rearranged RET hybrid oncogenes (1) is present in a similar percentage of HCCs when compared with the literature on nonoxyphilic PTCs, (2) defines PTC-like HCCs better than histomorphologic characterization, (3) excludes HCCs as a subgroup of FTCs, and (4) may play a role in the early tumorigenesis of oncocytic tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects an estimated 370 million people worldwide. HBV is endemic throughout the world, and insidiously causes liver damage over years and decades without any warning symptoms or signs. Up to 25-35% of infected individuals eventually die due to complications of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by HBV. Screening those individuals at risk of acquiring hepatitis B, and universal vaccination for prevention, would help in limiting the spread and public health repercussions of the virus. Although many new antiviral therapies have been developed for the management of hepatitis B, they still do not offer the possibility of cure. Most individuals who begin oral suppressive therapy will be indefinitely treated. Continuous suppression of HBV replication in individuals with advanced liver disease prolongs life, decreases the need for liver transplantation, and potentially reduces the risk for HCC. In this clinical review, we present a practical approach to prevention of HBV, its natural history and life cycle, as well as its management.",

NAFLD can occur at all ages, and the highest prevalence is found in the age group of 35-55 years. NAFLD is becoming the commonest cause leading to hepatic cirrhosis, but there is no prescribed therapy for this common condition. Reduction in body weight may reverse the condition. Aim: To find the prevalence of NAFLD in a cohort of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in this part of the country and also to evaluate the usefulness of routine liver biopsy for the diagnosis of NAFLD. Materials and methods: Interventional type of cross-sectional study. In all, 200 consecutive patients underwent a liver biopsy at the end of a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and detailed histopathological examination was done. Clinical, biochemical, demographic, and anthropometric variables were obtained prospectively. NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) was obtained for each patient. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 22. Results: A total of 200 patients (140 females and 60 males) were included in the study. In all, 138 patients were categorized as non-nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 39 patients as borderline/suspicious NASH, and 23 patients had definitive NASH. A higher body mass index, weight, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, alkaline phosphatise, and weight circumference were found in patients with NASH. Conclusion: The high prevalence of NAFLD in patients with gallstone disease may justify routine liver biopsy during cholecystectomy to establish the diagnosis, stage, and possibly direct therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes produce therapeutic biomarkers. However, the characteristics and significance of DDR alterations remain undefined in primary liver cancer (PLC). Experimental design: Patients diagnosed with PLC were enrolled in the trial (PTHBC, NCT02715089). Tumors and matched blood samples from participants were collected for a targeted next-generation sequencing assay containing exons of 450 cancer-related genes, including 31 DDR genes. The OncoKB knowledge database was used to identify and classify actionable alterations, and therapeutic regimens were determined after discussion by a multidisciplinary tumor board. Results: A total of 357 patients with PLC were enrolled, including 214 with hepatocellular carcinoma, 122 with ICC, and 21 with mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. A total of 92 (25.8%) patients had at least one DDR gene mutation, 15 of whom carried germline mutations. The most commonly altered DDR genes were ATM (5%) and BRCA1/2 (4.8%). The occurrence of DDR mutations was significantly correlated with a higher tumor mutation burden regardless of the PLC pathologic subtype. For DDR-mutated PLC, 26.1% (24/92) of patients possessed at least one actionable alteration, and the actionable frequency in DDR wild-type PLC was 18.9% (50/265). Eight patients with the BRCA mutation were treated by olaparib, and patients with BRCA2 germline truncation mutations showed an objective response. Conclusions: The landscape of DDR mutations and their association with genetic and clinicopathologic features demonstrated that patients with PLC with altered DDR genes may be rational candidates for precision oncology treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is a consequence of heterozygous germline mutation in HNF1A. A subtype of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is also caused by biallelic somatic HNF1A mutations (H-HCA), and rare HCA may be related to MODY3. To better understand a relationship between the development of MODY3 and HCA, we compared both germline and somatic spectra of HNF1A mutations. Research design and methods: We compared 151 somatic HNF1A mutations in HCA with 364 germline mutations described in MODY3. We searched for genotoxic and oxidative stress features in HCA and surrounding liver tissue. Results: A spectrum of HNF1A somatic mutations significantly differed from the germline changes in MODY3. In HCA, we identified a specific hot spot at codon 206, nonsense and frameshift mutations mainly in the NH(2)-terminal part, and almost all amino acid substitutions were restricted to the POU-H domain. The high frequency of G-to-T tranversions, predominantly found on the nontranscribed DNA strand, suggested a genotoxic mechanism. However, no features of oxidative stress were observed in the nontumor liver tissue. Finally, in a few MODY3 patients with HNF1A germline mutation leading to amino acid substitutions outside the POU-H domain, we identified a different subtype of HCA either with a gp130 and/or CTNNB1 activating mutation. Conclusions: Germline HNF1A mutations could be associated with different molecular subtypes of HCA. H-HCA showed mutations profoundly inactivating hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha function; they are associated with a genotoxic signature suggesting a specific toxicant exposure that could be associated with genetic predisposition.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenetic, autosomal dominantly inherited form of diabetes. HNF1A-MODY is associated with HNF1A-inactivated hepatocellular adenoma (H-HCA) formation. Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) are benign liver tumours and related complications are rare but serious: hepatic haemorrhage and malignant transformation. Guidelines recommend resection of all HCA in men and do not take any co-occurring metabolic disorders into account. We report a family with HCA preceding diabetes mellitus. Male index patient presented with numerous, irresectable HCA. After initial diagnostic and aetiologic uncertainty HNF1A germline mutation c.815G>A (p.Arg272His) was confirmed 8 years later. No HCA-related complications occurred. His diabetic mother was diagnosed with HCA after severe hepatic haemorrhage years before. HNF1A-MODY should be considered in (non-)diabetic (male) patients with H-HCA. We advocate liver biopsy and, if necessary, genetic analysis to precede any intervention for HCA in males and screening for HCA in HNF1A-MODY patients.",

    "Abstract": "Biallelic somatic mutations of TCF1 coding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) are found in 50% of the hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) cases usually associated with oral contraception. In rare cases, HNF1alpha germ line mutations could also predispose to familial adenomatosis. In order to identify new genetic factors predisposing to HNF1alpha-mutated HCA, we searched for mutations in genes involved in the metabolism of estrogen. For 10 genes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, COMT, UGT2B7, NQO1, GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1), we did not find mutations nor differences in the allele distribution among 32 women presenting HNF1alpha-mutated adenomas compared with 58 controls. In contrast, we identified a CYP1B1 germ line heterozygous mutation in 4 of 32 women presenting HNF1alpha-mutated adenomas compared with none in 58 controls. We confirmed these results with the identification of four additional CYP1B1 mutations in a second series of 26 cases. No mutations were found in the control group, which was extended to 98 individuals, and only a known rare genetic variant was observed in two controls (P = 0.0003). We did an ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase assay to evaluate the functional consequence of the CYP1B1 mutations. We found reduced enzymatic activity in each CYP1B1 variant. In addition, an E229K CYP1B1 mutation was found in a woman with a germ line HNF1alpha mutation in a familial adenomatosis context. In this large family, all three patients with adenomatosis bore both HNF1 and CYP1B1 germ line mutations. In conclusion, our data suggested that CYP1B1 germ line-inactivating mutations might increase the incidence of HCA in women with HNF1alpha mutations.",

This report describes a 23-year-old woman with maturity-onset diabetes of the young who developed a 12.5-cm hepatic mass with a radiographically and pathologically distinct 3.0-cm region. Histologically and immunohistochemically, the bulk of the mass was an H-HCA with extensive pseudoglandular formation and only focal steatosis. The 3.0-cm nodule showed small cell change, thickened hepatocyte plates, pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei, reticulin loss, and stromal and vascular invasion, diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemically, increased expression of glutamine synthetase in tumor cells and CD34 expression in sinusoidal endothelial cells were seen in the HCC component. Nuclear expression of β-catenin, and exon 3 of CTNNB1 and TERT promoter mutations were absent in this case. Thus, we report a HCC arising in an H-HCA; although cases appear exceedingly rare, they reinforce the potential of H-HCA for malignant transformation.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations of Hepatocyte-Nuclear-Factor-1-Homeobox-A (HNF1A) gene and loss of Liver-Fatty-Acid-Binding-Protein (LFABP) are well documented in hepatocellular adenoma. However, the role of HNF1A mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma remains to be determined. In this study, all hepatocellular neoplasms evaluated by our institutional Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutational Profiling of Actionable Clinical Targets assay or the Cancer Genome Atlas sequencing, and cases reported in the literature, were queried for HNF1A mutations. Together, 11 of 672 (1.6%) hepatocellular carcinomas harbored HNF1A mutations. The single case from our institution (n = 153) was extremely well differentiated, arising in a background of adenomatosis. Both the adenoma and carcinoma component contained the same 2 somatic HNF1A mutations (p. E32* and L214Q), with loss of LFABP. From the literature, 2 of 146 (1.4%) hepatocellular carcinomas had HNF1A mutations, and both arose in a background of adenomatosis. Information on pre-existing adenoma for the remaining cases (8/373, from The Cancer Genome Atlas) was not available. HNF1A mutations in carcinomas were associated with negative viral hepatitis status (p = .004), mutually exclusive with catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) hotspot mutations, and trended to occur more in females (p = .06) and without cirrhosis (p = .03). Grade was not associated with HNF1A status (p = .28). Somatic HNF1A mutations occur in approximately 1% to 2% of hepatocellular carcinoma, often in a background of adenomatosis. Our findings suggest that malignant transformation of HNF1A-mutated hepatocellular adenoma occurs, albeit infrequently. Hepatocellular adenomas with HNF1A mutation or adenomatosis with loss of LFABP warrant thorough sampling and examination.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign liver tumors that usually develop in women who are taking oral contraceptives. Among these tumors, biallelic inactivating mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) transcription factor have been frequently identified and in rare cases of hepatocellular carcinomas developed in noncirrhotic liver. Because HNF1A meets the genetic criteria of a tumor suppressor gene, we aimed to elucidate the tumorigenic mechanisms related to HNF1alpha inactivation in hepatocytes. We searched for signaling pathways aberrantly activated in human HNF1A-mutated HCA (H-HCA) using a genome-wide transcriptome analysis comparing five H-HCA with four normal livers. We validated the main pathways by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting in a large series of samples. Then, we assessed the role of HNF1alpha in the observed deregulations in hepatocellular cell models (HepG2 and Hep3B) by silencing its endogenous expression using small interfering RNA. Along with the previously described induction of glycolysis and lipogenesis, H-HCA also displayed overexpression of several genes encoding growth factor receptors, components of the translation machinery, cell cycle, and angiogenesis regulators, with, in particular, activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Moreover, estradiol detoxification activities were shut down, suggesting a hypersensitivity of H-HCA to estrogenic stimulation. In the cell model, inhibition of HNF1alpha recapitulated most of these identified transcriptional deregulations, demonstrating that they were related to HNF1alpha inhibition. Conclusion: H-HCA showed a combination of alterations related to HNF1alpha inactivation that may cooperate to promote tumor development. Interestingly, mTOR appears as a potential new attractive therapeutic target for treatment of this group of HCAs.",

Histology revealed a severely steatotic HCA. Immunohistochemistry showed no nuclear staining for β-catenin, limited glutamine synthetase positivity, and slightly attenuated liver-fatty acid binding protein staining. Serum amyloid A2 antibodies produced a coarse granular staining. Mutational screening detected monoallelic partial tandem duplication within exon 4 of TCF1 in tumoral tissue. No mutations in the β-catenin and IL6ST genes were detected. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed lower expression levels of FABP1 and uridine glycosyltransferase 2B7 and higher levels of serum amyloid A2 in tumor than in normal hepatocytes. Clinicopathological and molecular investigation of HCA cases with unique features could result in a better understanding of HCAs pathogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenomas are benign tumors that can be difficult to diagnose. To refine their classification, we performed a comprehensive analysis of their genetic, pathological, and clinical features. A multicentric series of 96 liver tumors with a firm or possible diagnosis of hepatocellular adenoma was reviewed by liver pathologists. In all cases, the genes coding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) and beta-catenin were sequenced. No tumors were mutated in both HNF1alpha and beta-catenin enabling tumors to be classified into 3 groups, according to genotype. Tumors with HNF1alpha mutations formed the most important group of adenomas (44 cases). They were phenotypically characterized by marked steatosis (P < 10(-4)), lack of cytological abnormalities (P < 10(-6)), and no inflammatory infiltrates (P < 10(-4)). In contrast, the group of tumors defined by beta-catenin activation included 13 lesions with frequent cytological abnormalities and pseudo-glandular formation (P < 10(-5)). The third group of tumors without mutation was divided into two subgroups based on the presence of inflammatory infiltrates. The subgroup of tumors consisting of 17 inflammatory lesions, resembled telangiectatic focal nodular hyperplasias, with frequent cytological abnormalities (P = 10(-3)), ductular reaction (P < 10(-2)), and dystrophic vessels (P = .02). In this classification, hepatocellular carcinoma associated with adenoma or borderline lesions between carcinoma and adenoma is found in 46% of the beta-catenin-mutated tumors whereas they are never observed in inflammatory lesions and are rarely found in HNF1alpha mutated tumors (P = .004). In conclusion, the molecular and pathological classification of hepatocellular adenomas permits the identification of strong genotype-phenotype correlations and suggests that adenomas with beta-catenin activation have a higher risk of malignant transformation.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are benign liver tumors mainly related to oral contraception and classified into 4 molecular subgroups: inflammatory (IHCA), HNF1A-inactivated (H-HCA), β-catenin-activated (bHCA) or unclassified (UHCA). Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD) is a rare hereditary metabolic disease that predisposes to HCA development. The aim of our study was to characterize the molecular profile of GSD-associated HCA. Methods: We characterized a series of 25 HCAs developed in 15 patients with GSD by gene expression and DNA sequence of HNF1A, CTNNB1, IL6ST, GNAS, and STAT3 genes. Moreover, we searched for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid synthesis alterations in GSD non-tumor livers and compared our results to those observed in a series of sporadic H-HCA and various non-GSD liver samples. Results: GSD adenomas were classified as IHCA (52%) mutated for IL6ST or GNAS, bHCA (28%) or UHCA (20%). In contrast, no HNF1A inactivation was observed, showing a different molecular subtype distribution in GSD-associated HCA from that observed in sporadic HCA (p = 0.0008). In non-tumor GSD liver samples, we identified glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis activation with gluconeogenesis repression. Interestingly, this gene expression profile was similar to that observed in sporadic H-HCA. Conclusions: Our study showed a particular molecular profile in GSD-related HCA characterized by a lack of HNF1A inactivation. This exclusion could be explained by similar metabolic defects observed with HNF1A inactivation and glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. Inversely, the high frequency of β-catenin mutations could be related to the increased frequency of malignant transformation in hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) may rarely develop hepatocellular adenoma. Here we report the case of a 37-year-old FAP woman presenting a hepatocellular adenoma after oestroprogestative oral contraception use. In this steatotic adenoma, we identified an inactivating biallelic mutation of HNF1alpha. In addition to the known germline APC mutation Q1062fs, we did not find an inactivation of the second APC allele nor an activation of the beta-catenin target genes GLUL and GPR49. Our findings contrast with two hepatocellular adenoma cases related to FAP, for which a biallelic inactivation of the APC gene was previously described. Altogether, these results suggest that benign hepatocellular carcinogenesis may be dependent on or independent of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in patients with FAP.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Liver adenomatosis (LA) is characterized by the presence of at least 10 hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), but the natural history of this rare liver disorder remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to reappraise the natural history and the risk of complications in a cohort of patients with at least 10 HCAs. Methods: We analyzed the natural history of 40 patients with LA, excluding glycogen storage disorders, in a monocentric cohort. Pathological examination was performed, with immunostaining and molecular biology carried out on surgical specimens or liver biopsies. Results: Forty patients (36 female) were included with a median follow-up of 10.6 (1.9-26.1) years. Six (15%) patients had familial LA, all with germline HNF1A mutations. Median age at diagnosis was 39 (9-55) years. Thirty-three (94%) women had a history of oral contraception, and 29 (81%) women had a pregnancy before LA diagnosis. Overall, thirty-seven (93%) patients underwent surgery at diagnosis. Classification of HCAs showed 46% of patients with HNF1A-mutated HCA, 31% with inflammatory HCA, 3% with sonic hedgehog HCA, 8% with unclassified HCA. Only 15% of the patients demonstrated a \"mixed LA\" with different HCA subtypes. Hepatic complications were identified in 7 patients: 1 patient (3%) died from recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation; 6 (15%) had hemorrhages, of which 5 occurred at diagnosis, with 1 fatal case during pregnancy, and 2 occurred in male patients with familial LA. Four patients (10%) had repeated liver resections. Finally, 4 (10%) patients developed extrahepatic malignancies during follow-up. Conclusions: The diversity in HCA subtypes, as well as the occurrence of bleeding and malignant transformation during long-term follow-up, underline the heterogeneous nature of LA, justifying close and specific management. In patients with germline HNF1A mutation, familial LA occurred equally frequently in males and females, with a higher rate of bleeding in male patients. Lay summary: Liver adenomatosis is a rare disease characterized by the presence of 10 or more hepatocellular adenomas that may rarely be of genetic origin. Patients with liver adenomatosis have multiple adenomas of different subtypes, with a risk of bleeding and malignant transformation that justify a specific management and follow-up.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign liver tumors that can be assigned to molecular subtypes based on inactivating mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A, activating mutations in β-catenin, or activation of inflammatory signaling pathways. We aimed to update the classification system for HCA and associate the subtypes with disease risk factors and complications. Methods: We analyzed expression levels of 20 genes and sequenced exon regions of 8 genes (HNF1A, IL6ST, CTNNB1, FRK, STAT3, GNAS, JAK1, and TERT) in 607 samples of 533 HCAs from 411 patients, collected from 28 centers mainly in France from 2000 and 2014. We performed gene expression profile, RNA sequence, whole-exome and genome sequence, and immunohistochemical analyses of select samples. Molecular data were associated with risk factors, histopathology, bleeding, and malignant transformation. Results: Symptomatic bleeding occurred in 14% of the patients (85% of cases were female, median age, 38 years); 7% of the nodules were borderline between HCA and hepatocellular carcinoma, and 3% of patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma from HCA. Based on molecular features, we classified HCA into 8 subgroups. One new subgroup, composed of previously unclassified HCA, represented 4% of HCAs overall and was associated with obesity and bleeding. These tumors were characterized by activation of sonic hedgehog signaling, due to focal deletions that fuse the promoter of INHBE with GLI1. Analysis of genetic heterogeneity among multiple HCAs, from different patients, revealed a molecular subtype field effect; multiple tumors had different mutations that deregulated similar pathways. Specific molecular subtypes of HCA associated with various HCA risk factors, including imbalances in estrogen or androgen hormones. Specific molecular subgroup of HCA with β-catenin and sonic hedgehog activation associated with malignant transformation and bleeding, respectively. Conclusions: Using sequencing and gene expression analyses, we identified a subgroup of HCA characterized by fusion of the INHBE and GLI1 genes and activation of sonic hedgehog pathway. Molecular subtypes of HCAs associated with different patients' risk factors for HCA, disease progression, and pathology features of tumors. This classification system might be used to select treatment strategies for patients with HCA.",

    "Abstract": "Liver adenomas are benign tumors at risk of malignant transformation. In a genome-wide search for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) associated with liver adenomas, we found a deletion in chromosome 12q in five of ten adenomas. In most cases, LOH at 12q was the only recurrent genetic alteration observed, suggesting the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene in that region. A minimal common region of deletion was defined in 12q24 that included the gene TCF1 (transcription factor 1), encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1; refs 1,2). Heterozygous germline mutations of TCF1 have been identified in individuals affected with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3; ref. 3). Bi-allelic inactivation of TCF1 was found in 10 of 16 screened adenomas, and heterozygous germline mutation were present in three affected individuals. Furthermore, 2 well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) occurring in normal liver contained somatic bi-allelic mutations of 30 screened HCCs. These results indicate that inactivation of TCF1, whether sporadic or associated with MODY3, is an important genetic event in the occurrence of human liver adenoma, and may be an early step in the development of some HCCs.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a frequent long-term complication of glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I) and malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known to occur in some cases. However, the molecular pathogenesis of tumor development in GSD I is unclear. This study was conducted to systematically investigate chromosomal and genetic alterations in HCA associated with GSD I. Genome-wide SNP analysis and mutation detection of target genes was performed in ten GSD Ia-associated HCA and seven general population HCA cases for comparison. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 60% of the GSD Ia HCA and 57% of general population HCA. Intriguingly, simultaneous gain of chromosome 6p and loss of 6q were only seen in GSD Ia HCA (three cases) with one additional GSD I patient showing submicroscopic 6q14.1 deletion. The sizes of GSD Ia adenomas with chromosome 6 aberrations were larger than the sizes of adenomas without the changes (P = 0.012). Expression of IGF2R and LATS1 candidate tumor suppressor genes at 6q was reduced in more than 50% of GSD Ia HCA that were examined (n = 7). None of the GSD Ia HCA had biallelic mutations in the HNF1A gene. These findings give the first insight into the distinct genomic and genetic characteristics of HCA associated with GSD Ia. These results strongly suggest that chromosome 6 alterations could be an early event in the liver tumorigenesis in GSD I, and may be in general population. These results also suggest an interesting relationship between GSD Ia HCA and steps to HCC transformation.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) is a liver-enriched transcription factor that regulates many aspects of hepatocyte functions. Our previous studies have demonstrated that HNF1α has potent therapeutic effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations in HNF1α gene are frequently associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) and hepatocellular adenomas. However, the association of HNF1α mutation and HCC remains elusive. In this study, the point mutation of HNF1α gene with c.A1532 > T/p.Q511L was identified in an HCC patient by exon-capture high-throughput sequencing. Mutation of c.A1532 > T/p.Q511L in HNF1α gene was only detected in the tumor tissue but not in the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue of the patient. Luciferase reporter assay and real-time PCR revealed that mutation of p.Q511L reduced the transcriptional activity of HNF1α. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fraction analysis revealed that mutation of p.Q511L disturbed the intracellular localization of HNF1α in HCC cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of HNF1α on the proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC cells was also partially abolished by the mutation of p.Q511L. Our data suggested that the missense mutation of HNF1α (p.Q511L) may associate with the progression of HCC.",

We aimed to review our cases of micro/small H-HCA discovered by chance on different kinds of liver resected specimens. Methods: We retrieved cases of micro/small H-HCA discovered by chance on resected specimens outside the context of H-HCA. All these nodules were liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP)-negative contrasting with normal positivity in the surrounding non-tumoural liver, ruling out the possibility of focal steatosis or other subtypes of micro-HCAs. Results: We identified 19 micro/small H-HCA cases. In 16 cases they were discovered in patients who underwent surgery for benign nodules including one haemangioma, six focal nodular hyperplasia, seven inflammatory HCA (including one with b-catenin activation), one HCA, whose subtype could not be identified because of massive necrosis/hemorrhage, and one hepatocellular carcinoma. In two additional cases, patients followed up for a melanoma underwent liver surgery to remove micro nodules possibly related to a metastatic process. Finally in one case a micro nodule was seen and resected during a cholecystectomy. Conclusion: Taken together, H-HCAs are more frequent than we initially supposed as micro and small HCAs cannot all be detected by routine ultrasound. Despite no information on the potential growth of these micro/small H-HCAs, there is no argument to stop oral contraceptives or to ask for a specific regular surveillance. The association of different subtypes of HCAs with focal nodular hyperplasia suggests they share or have common etiological factors.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenoma is considered to occur exclusively in non-fibrotic livers. It is a heterogeneous entity and a molecular classification is now widely accepted. The most frequent hepatocellular adenoma subtype, namely inflammatory adenoma, harbor somatic activating mutations of genes involved in the interleukin-6 pathway that lead to high C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A expression. The aim of our study was to investigate a series of benign hepatocellular neoplasms developed on cirrhotic livers and characterized by an unequivocal histological diagnosis. We performed a clinical, pathological, and molecular study of 10 benign hepatocellular neoplasms developed in three patients with cirrhosis. Markers allowing hepatocellular adenoma classification were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Samples were sequenced for CTNNB1, HNF1A, IL6ST, GNAS, STAT3, and TERT (promoter) mutations. A control series of 32 classical macronodules developed in cirrhosis related to various etiologies was screened by immunohistochemistry and gene sequencing. The three patients had cirrhosis related to metabolic syndrome and/or alcohol intake; two had a single tumor, while the third developed more than 30 lesions. Microscopic examination showed well-differentiated neoplasms sharing features with inflammatory adenoma including inflammatory infiltrates, sinusoidal dilatation, and dystrophic vessels. Sequencing revealed classical hotspot somatic mutations (IL6ST, n=8; STAT3, n=1; and GNAS, n=1) known to be responsible for IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway activation. Two classical high-grade macronodules demonstrated high serum amyloid A and/or C-reactive protein expression, without gene mutations. Altogether, our findings support the existence of rare inflammatory adenoma developed in cirrhosis.",

Accordingly, HCA is currently classified into four molecular subtypes as adopted by the World Health Organization. The present study was firstly to characterize and determine the genetic alterations and clinicopathological features of the largest series of HCAs in China. We reviewed 189 patients with HCA who underwent hepatectomies at our liver center from January 1984 to January 2012, among which 36 HCAs were randomly selected for the sequencing of HNF1α, β-catenin and gp130 genes, and 60 HCAs were randomly selected for detecting microsatellite instability (MSI). Compared with Western studies, our data showed distinctive findings including male (69.8%) and overweight/obese (50.3%) predominance. Only 3.5% of female patients had a documented history of OCs use for 2-4 years. All 36 sequenced HCAs showed HNF1α mutations (72% missense, 28% synonymous), 2 hotspot polymorphisms of HNF1α (I27L: rs1169288 and S487N: rs2464196) were seen in 17 (47%) and 10 (27.8%) cases, respectively, and a novel single nucleotide polymorphism site (rs1169304) in intron 9 of HNF1α was detected in 32 (88%) cases, but no β-catenin or gp130 gene mutation was detected, and no nuclear β-catenin staining was detected by immunohistochemistry. The frequency of MSI was 75% for D12S1398 (HNF1α inactivated pathway) and 78.5% for D6S1064 (HIPPO signaling pathway) in 34 overweight/obese patients with HCA. Our results firstly indicate that patients with HCA in China frequently occur in male overweigh and obese adult population, lack an association with OCs use and exhibit unique genetic alterations. Taken together, these observations suggest that alternative pathogenetic pathways involve in HCA tumorigenesis in Chinese patients.",

    "Abstract": "The molecular classification of hepatocellular adenomas highlights a distinctive genotype-phenotype correlation. Malignant transformation is an exceptionally rare complication of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1A)-inactivated hepatocellular adenomas. This subtype is characterized by loss of liver fatty acid binding protein immunoexpression. In this study, we characterized the histopathologic spectrum of 13 liver fatty acid binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma cases showing malignant transformation from multiple centers. Clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients were evaluated. Stains for reticulin, liver fatty acid binding protein, beta-catenin and glutamine synthetase were applied to these lesions. Moreover, the findings were compared to patients with β-catenin mutated hepatocellular adenoma. Liver fatty acid binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenomas with borderline features/carcinoma were seen predominantly in females (77%) with an average age of 46 ± 18 years and multiple lesions (77%; five patients with adenomatosis). Meanwhile, β-catenin mutated hepatocellular adenoma patients with malignant transformation were predominantly male (67%, p = 0.018) with single lesion (86%, p = 0.0009). The largest liver fatty acid binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma nodule in each patient ranged from 4 to 15.5 cm. Loss of liver fatty acid binding protein by immunohistochemistry was noted in all adenoma and borderline/carcinoma components. Features of malignant transformation were pseudoglandular architecture (85%), cytologic atypia (85%), architectural atypia (100%) and lack of steatosis (100%). Other findings included myxoid change (39%), peliosis (46%) and sinusoidal dilatation (46%). Molecular studies confirmed somatic inactivation of HNF1A in 3 cases and absence of TERT promotor and exon 3 CTNNB1 mutations in five cases. To summarize, liver fatty acid binding protein-deficient hepatocellular adenoma with malignant transformation is most frequently seen in female patients with multiple lesions. Most of these lesions demonstrate pseudoglandular architecture, cytologic and architectural atypia, with lack of steatosis. The natural history of these lesions is relatively benign with the exception of disease recurrence in 1 patient.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are rare benign tumours occurring mainly in women under oral contraceptives. HCA bleed frequently and transform rarely into hepatocellular carcinoma. Identification of genes recurrently mutated in HCA and good genotype/phenotype correlations provided the basis of a pathomolecular classification of different HCA subgroups, characterized using immunohistochemical markers. HNF1A-mutated HCA: Biallelic-inactivating mutations of HNF1A gene are identified in 35-40% of HCA. HNF1alpha-inactivated HCA display characteristic pathological features, including marked steatosis. The expression of FABP1 (which is a HNF1A target gene) is downregulated and the absence of L-FABP expression diagnosed this subgroup. beta-Catenin-mutated HCA: beta-catenin mutations leading to activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway represented 10-15% of HCA. They are characterized by overexpression of glutamine synthetase and aberrant nuclear beta-catenin staining. These beta-catenin-activated HCA are at greater risk of malignant transformation; they are difficult to differentiate from well-differentiated HCC. Inflammatory HCA (50%): These are defined by the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, sinusoidal dilatation and thick-walled arteries. Small in-frame deletions that target the binding site of gp130 for IL-6 have been reported in 60% of inflammatory HCA. There is an overexpression of the inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein in tumour hepatocytes both at mRNA and protein levels. Inflammatory HCA occurred more frequently in patients with high body mass index; they can be also mutated for beta-catenin and therefore are probably at risk of HCC. Unclassified HCA: Less than 10% of HCA do not express any of the above-mentioned phenotypic markers. Taking into account noticeable differences between the HCA subgroups, in terms of clinical and prognostic features, phenotyping may become an important tool for HCA management strategy.",

CTNNB1 mutated HCA in exon 3 and sonic hedgehog HCA have been linked with a high risk of malignant transformation and bleeding respectively.

Ten percent of I-HCA are also β-catenin activated. We report a rare case of three histologically confirmed steatotic HCAs of three different phenotypes: I-HCA, β-catenin activated I-HCA, and H-HCA in a 36-year-old woman. This observation outlines that in the same patient, HCA may be of different subtypes. The predisposition to develop different HCA hypothetically caused by a \"benign tumorigenic field effect\" may result, even rarely, in different genotypes/phenotypes such as H-HCA and I-HCA.

    "Abstract": "Loss of expression of liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) by immunohistochemistry has been shown to be characteristic of a subset of hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) in which HNF1A is inactivated. Transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma is thought to be a very rare phenomenon in the HNF1A-inactivated variant of HCA. However, we recently observed 2 cases at our institution, 1 definite hepatocellular carcinoma and 1 possible hepatocellular carcinoma, with loss of LFABP staining, raising the possibility that LFABP down-regulation may be associated with hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Our aim was to evaluate hepatocellular carcinomas arising in various backgrounds and with varying degrees of differentiation for loss of LFABP staining. Twenty total cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were examined. Thirteen cases arose in a background of cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (n = 8) or steatohepatitis (n = 5); 7 cases arose in a noncirrhotic background, with 2 cases arising within HNF1A-inactivated variant HCA and 2 cases arising within inflammatory variant HCA. Complete loss of expression of LFABP was seen in 6 of 20 cases, including 2 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma arising within HNF1A-inactivated variant HCA. Thus, loss of staining for LFABP appears to be common in hepatocellular carcinoma and may be seen in well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, LFABP loss should not be interpreted as evidence for hepatocellular adenoma over carcinoma, when other features support a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The findings raise consideration for a role of HNF1A inactivation in hepatocellular carcinogenesis, particularly in less differentiated tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compose hepatocellular neoplasms that occur in adults. These tumors demonstrate characteristic epidemiologic and histopathologic features and clinical and imaging manifestations. HCAs are monoclonal neoplasms characterized by increased predilection to hemorrhage or rupture and occasional transformation to HCC. On the other hand, FNH is a polyclonal tumorlike lesion that occurs in response to increased perfusion and has an indolent clinical course. Up to 90% of HCCs occur in the setting of cirrhosis. Chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and hepatitis C) infection and metabolic syndrome are major risk factors that can induce HCCs in nonfibrotic liver. Recent advances in pathology and genetics have led to better understanding of the histogenesis, natural history, and molecular events that determine specific oncologic pathways used by these neoplasms. HCAs are now believed to result from specific genetic mutations involving TCF1 (transcription factor 1 gene), IL6ST (interleukin 6 signal transducer gene), and CTNNB1 (β catenin-1 gene); FNHs are characterized by an \"imbalance\" of angiopoietin. While the β catenin signaling pathway is associated with well- and moderately differentiated HCCs, mutations involving p53 (tumor protein 53 gene), MMP14 (matrix metalloproteinase 14 gene), and RhoC (Ras homolog gene family, member C) are associated with larger tumor size, higher tumor grade with resultant shortened tumor-free survival, and poor prognosis. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), a unique HCC subtype, exhibits genomic homogeneity that partly explains its better overall prognosis. On the basis of recent study results involving cytogenetics and oncologic pathways of HCCs, novel drugs that act against molecular targets are being developed. Indeed, sorafenib (a multikinase inhibitor) is currently being used in the successful treatment of patients with advanced HCC. Characterization of genetic abnormalities and genotype-phenotype correlations in adult hepatocellular tumors provides better understanding of tumor pathology and biology, imaging findings, prognosis, and response to molecular therapeutics.",

We report a case of a 35-year-old Japanese woman who exhibited hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1α-inactivated HCA in the background of the congenital absence of the portal vein (CAPV). On a dynamic contrast computed tomography (CT) scan, the hypovascular tumor enlarged from 1 cm to 3 cm and another tumor emerged in the course of 7 years. Because the possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with multiple metastases was not excluded, partial hepatectomy was performed. On a cut section, two well-demarcated tumors were observed and one tumor had a central fibrous scar. The histological features of these tumors were similar to those of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) with a central scar and HCA; however, these tumors were diagnosed as HNF-1α-inactivated HCA by immunohistochemistry according to the criteria of the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. In non-tumorous liver tissue, an abnormal architecture of the vessels and a vague nodular appearance of lobuli were observed, which were likely to be those of nodular regenerated hyperplasia (NRH). We discuss its pathogenesis and relationship with CAPV.",

Our previous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of HNF1α on hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in animals. In this study, we created hepatocyte-specific Hnf1α knockout mice using the Cre-loxP recombination system. The knockout mice display increased fatty acid synthesis in the liver. Moreover, these mice spontaneously develop HCC through fatty liver without cirrhosis. Inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6, are upregulated and accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Akt, p-65 and STAT3 in the livers of HNF1α knockout mice. Our findings suggest that HNF1α plays a crucial role in hepatocyte lipid metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are benign liver tumors predominantly developed in women using oral contraceptives. Here, exome sequencing identified recurrent somatic FRK mutations that induce constitutive kinase activity, STAT3 activation, and cell proliferation sensitive to Src inhibitors. We also found uncommon recurrent mutations activating JAK1, gp130, or β-catenin. Chromosome copy number and methylation profiling revealed patterns that correlated with specific gene mutations and tumor phenotypes. Finally, integrative analysis of HCAs transformed to hepatocellular carcinoma revealed β-catenin mutation as an early alteration and TERT promoter mutations as associated with the last step of the adenoma-carcinoma transition. In conclusion, we identified the genomic diversity in benign hepatocyte proliferation, several therapeutic targets, and the key genomic determinants of the adenoma-carcinoma transformation sequence.",

    "Abstract": "Molecular classifications defining new tumor subtypes have been recently refined with genetic and transcriptomic analyses of benign and malignant hepatocellular tumors. Here, we performed microRNA (miRNA) profiling in two series of fully annotated liver tumors to uncover associations between oncogene/tumor suppressor mutations and clinical and pathological features. Expression levels of 250 miRNAs in 46 benign and malignant hepatocellular tumors were compared to those of 4 normal liver samples with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. miRNAs associated with genetic and clinical characteristics were validated in a second series of 43 liver tumor samples and 16 nontumor samples. miRNA profiling unsupervised analysis classified samples in unique clusters characterized by histological features (tumor/nontumor, P < 0.001; benign/malignant tumors, P < 0.01; inflammatory adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia, P < 0.01), clinical characteristics [hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, P < 0.001; alcohol consumption, P < 0.05], and oncogene/tumor suppressor gene mutations [beta-catenin, P < 0.01; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha), P < 0.01]. Our study identified and validated miR-224 overexpression in all tumors and miR-200c, miR-200, miR-21, miR-224, miR-10b, and miR-222 specific deregulation in benign or malignant tumors. Moreover, miR-96 was overexpressed in HBV tumors, and miR-126* was down-regulated in alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Down-regulations of miR-107 and miR-375 were specifically associated with HNF1alpha and beta-catenin gene mutations, respectively. miR-375 expression was highly correlated to that of beta-catenin-targeted genes as miR-107 expression was correlated to that of HNF1alpha in a small interfering RNA cell line model. Thus, this strongly suggests that beta-catenin and HNF1alpha could regulate miR-375 and miR-107 expression levels, respectively. Conclusion: Hepatocellular tumors may have a distinct miRNA expression fingerprint according to malignancy, risk factors, and oncogene/tumor suppressor gene alterations. Dissecting these relationships provides a new hypothesis to understand the functional impact of miRNA deregulation in liver tumorigenesis and the promising use of miRNAs as diagnostic markers.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in one copy of the hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF) 1alpha and 1beta homeodomain containing transcription factors predispose the carrier to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) types 3 and 5, respectively. Moreover, previous identification of biallelic inactivation of HNF1alpha in hepatocellular adenoma identified its tumor suppressor function in hepatocarcinogenesis. The seminal observation of an ovarian carcinoma in a MODY5 patient who subsequently developed a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, prompted us to screen for HNF1beta and HNF1alpha inactivation in a series of 20 ovarian and 35 renal neoplasms. Biallelic HNF1beta inactivation was found in two of 12 chromophobe renal carcinomas by association of a germline mutation and a somatic gene deletion. In these cases, the expression of PKHD1 (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1) and UMOD (Uromodulin), two genes regulated by HNF1beta, was turned off. Interestingly, in two of 13 clear cell renal carcinomas, we found a monoallelic germline mutation of HNF1alpha with no associated suppression of target mRNA expression. In normal and tumor renal tissues, we showed the existence of a network of transcription factors differentially regulated in tumor subtypes. We identified two related clusters of co-regulated genes associating HNF1beta, PKHD1 and UMOD in the first group and HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, FABP1 and UGT2B7 in the second group. Finally, these results suggest that germline mutations of HNF1beta and HNF1alpha may predispose to renal tumors. Furthermore, we suggest that HNF1beta functions as a tumor suppressor gene in chromophobe renal cell carcinogenesis through a PKHD1 expression control.",

    "Abstract": "We took advantage of the reported genotype/phenotype classification to analyze our surgical series of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA). The series without specific known etiologies included 128 cases (116 women). The number of nodules varies from single, <5, and >or=5 in 78, 38, and 12 cases, respectively. The resection was complete in 95 cases. We identified 46 HNF1alpha-inactivated HCAs (44 women), 63 inflammatory HCAs (IHCA, 53 women) of which nine were also beta-catenin-activated, and seven beta-catenin-activated HCAs (all women); six additional cases had no known phenotypic marker and six others could not be phenotypically analyzed. Twenty-three of 128 HCAs showed bleeding. No differences were observed in solitary or multiple tumors in terms of hemorrhagic manifestations between groups. In contrast, differences were observed between the two main groups. Steatosis (tumor), microadenomas (resected specimen), and additional benign nodules were more frequently observed in HNF1alpha-inactivated HCAs (P < 0.01) than in IHCAs. Body mass index > 25, peliosis (tumor), and steatosis in background liver were more frequent in IHCA (P < 0.01). After complete resection, new HCAs in the centimetric range were more frequently found during follow-up (>1 year) in HNF1alpha-inactivated HCA. After incomplete resection (HCA left in nonresected liver), the majority of HCA remained stable in the two main groups and even sometimes regressed. Six patients of 128 developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (all were beta-catenin-activated, whether inflammatory or not). Conclusion: There were noticeable clinical differences between HNF1alpha-inactivated HCA and IHCA; there was no increased risk of bleeding or HCC related to the number of HCAs; beta-catenin-activated HCAs are at higher risk of HCC. As a consequence, we believe that management of HCA needs to be adapted to the phenotype of these tumors.",

    "Abstract": "With regard to neoplasms of hepatocytes, diagnostic pitfalls have been reported for differentiation of liver cell adenoma (LCA) from well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Since cytophotometric analysis of the DNA content with the help of image analysis has proven to be of diagnostic value in various neoplasms, we examined its ability to discriminate between LCA and HCC as well as regenerative liver nodules. The material investigated consisted of 54 cases of HCC, 10 benign liver tumours and 10 cases suspicious for HCC. All the benign liver tumours demonstrated an euploid histogram. 9 out of 10 borderline tumours were euploid while 1 out of 10 was suspiciously aneuploid. Among HCC, 21 out of 54 were euploid, 18 out of 54 suspiciously and 15 out of 54 clearly aneuploid. 5c exceeding rate differed significantly between benign liver changes and borderline lesions (p = 0.0474) as well as between borderline lesions and malignant tumours (p = 0.0108). We conclude that the use of image cytometry is helpful as an additional criterion for more diagnostic accuracy in morphologically difficult cases.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Four subtypes of hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are recognized: hepatocyte-nuclear-factor-1α mutated (H-HCA), β-catenin-mutated type with upregulation of glutamine synthetase (b-HCA), inflammatory type (IHCA) with serum-amyloid-A overexpression, and unclassified type. Subtyping may be useful since b-HCA appear to have higher risk of malignant transformation. We sought to apply subtype analysis and assess histological atypia, correlating these with next-generation sequencing analysis. Methods: Twenty-six HCA were stained with serum amyloid A (SAA), liver fatty acid-binding protein (LFABP), glutamine synthetase (GS), and β-catenin IHC, followed by analysis with a targeted multiplex sequencing panel. Results: By IHC, 4 HCA (15.4 %) were classified as b-HCA, 11 (42.3 %) as IHCA, 9 (34.6 %) as H-HCA, and two (7.7 %) unclassifiable. Eight HCA (30.8 %) showed atypia (3 b-HCA, 4 IHCA and 1 H-HCA). Targeted sequencing confirmed HNF1A mutations in all H-HCA, confirming reliability of LFABP IHC in identifying these lesions. CTNNB1 mutations were detected in 1 of 4 (25 %) of GS/β-catenin-positive cases, suggesting that positive GS stain does not always correlate with CTNNB1 mutations. Conclusions: Immunohistochemistry does not consistently identify b-HCA. Mutational analysis improves the diagnostic accuracy of β-catenin-mutated HCA and is an important tool to assess risk of malignancy in HCA.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: A comparative quantitative methylation profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma and the most frequent benign liver tumor, hepatocellular adenoma, was set up for the identification of tumor-specific methylation patterns. Experimental design: The quantitative methylation levels of nine genes (RASSF1A, cyclinD2, p16INK4a, DAP-K, APC, RIZ-1, HIN-1, GSTpi1, SOCS-1) were analyzed in hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue (n = 41), hepatocellular adenoma and adjacent normal tissue (n = 26), focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 10), and unrelated normal liver tissue (n = 28). Accumulated methylation data were analyzed using various statistical algorithms, including hierarchical clustering, to detect tumor-specific methylation patterns. Results: Cluster analysis revealed that hepatocellular adenoma displays a methylation profile much more similar to that found in normal liver tissue and focal nodular hyperplasia than to that found in hepatocellular carcinoma. Many characteristic differences were not detected when using mere qualitative methylation assays. The cyclinD2 gene was identified as a new and frequent target for aberrant hypermethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (68%). In the control group of 28 liver specimens from healthy donors, a clear correlation between age of patient and frequency and level of aberrant methylation was seen, which could not be detected in the group of hepatocellular carcinoma specimens. Conclusions: Methylation profiling can clearly contribute to the unequivocal classification of suspicious lesions, but only if done in a quantitative manner applying cell type and gene-specific thresholds. In hepatocellular carcinoma, the altered methylation patterns accompanying malignant transformation override the age-dependent increase in gene methylation.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are rare, benign liver tumours that often occur in women of reproductive age. HCA has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives, but the increased incidence of the tumour in older women and in men has linked the tumour type to other diseases, including the metabolic syndrome. Genotypical classification of the adenomas has led to the identification of four subgroups that correlate genotype with phenotype: human hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1α) inactivating HCA, β-catenin activating HCA, inflammatory HCA and unclassified HCA. HNF1α inactivating HCA is associated with bi-allelic mutations in the TCF1 gene and morphologically has marked steatosis. β-catenin activating HCA has increased activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and is associated with possible malignant transformation. Inflammatory HCA is characterized by an oncogene-induced inflammation due to alterations in the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. In the diagnostic setting, sub classification of HCA is based primarily on immunohistochemical analyzes, and has had an increasing impact on choice of treatment and individual prognostic assessment. This review offers an overview of the reported gene mutations associated with hepatocellular adenomas together with a discussion of the diagnostic and prognostic value.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The relationship between sex hormones and hepatocellular adenoma development is well established. On the contrary, their contribution to liver adenomatosis (LA) development is still a debatable issue. Recently, inactivating mutations of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) transcription factor gene or activating mutations of beta-catenin have been demonstrated in some liver adenomas, and a possible link between HNF-1alpha gene mutations and oral contraceptives has been suggested. Only two cases of regressive LA after hormone withdrawal therapy have been described so far but without any information concerning the molecular characteristics of the tumours. Case: We report the case of a 48-year-old woman with LA, who had been taking an androgenic progestin therapy (lynestrenol) for 10 years. A major regression in the number and size of the lesions was observed 6 months after complete withdrawal of this therapy. Methods: Hepatocellular adenomas were studied by immunohistochemistry for oestrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors (ER, PR and AR respectively), and for beta-catenin. Direct sequencing of the HNF-1alpha gene was also performed. Results: For the first time, we demonstrate significant immunostaining of AR in the hepatocellular adenomas. This staining was negative in the partially regressive adenoma. Immunostainings for ER and PR were negative. HNF-1alpha and the beta-catenin pathways were not involved in tumour pathogenesis. Conclusions: Our case suggests a role of androgenic progestin therapy in some cases of LA. Hormone therapy withdrawal may induce a significant regression in lesions.",

    "Abstract": "Our study aims to investigate the impact of the Maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 disease-linked rSNP rs35126805 located in the HNF‑1α gene promotor on the binding of the transcription factor HNF‑4α and consequently on the regulation of HNF‑1α gene expression. Our focus is to calculate the change in the binding affinity of the transcription factor HNF‑4α to the DNA, caused by the regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism (rSNP) through molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic analysis of acquired results. Both root-mean-square difference (RMSD) and the relative binding free energy ΔΔGbind reveal that the HNF‑4α binds slightly more strongly to the DNA containing the mutation (rSNP) making the complex more stable/rigid, and thereby influencing the expression of the HNF‑1α gene. The resulting disruption of the HNF‑4α/HNF-1α pathway is also linked to hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis and enhanced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study where thermodynamic analysis of the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations is performed to uncover the influence of rSNP on the protein binding to DNA. Therefore, our approach can be generally applied for studying the impact of regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms on the binding of transcription factors to the DNA.",

Methods and results: We report nine cases with the coexistence of IHCA and H-HCA; eight occurred in women, and one in a man. The numbers of nodules and the sizes of the largest and smallest HCAs were variable. In one case, the nodules of the two different subtypes were discovered at different times. In all women, HCAs were histologically typical, regardless of their subtype, whereas H-HCA in the man differed histologically from classic H-HCA. Conclusions: These cases suggest that a predisposition to develop multiple adenomas, hypothetically caused by a 'benign tumorigenic field effect', although common to all HCAs, may result in different genotypes and phenotypes. Although this is rare, it is expected that more cases with the coexistence of different genotypes will emerge, owing to progress in the use of specific immunohistochemical approaches.",

We herein report the first case of a 28-year-old man with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) who experienced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within HCA. A preoperative computed tomography scan of the abdomen disclosed a tumor measuring 5.8 cm in diameter in the left lobe of the liver. A total proctocolectomy with construction of a linear stapled J-pouch, a hand-sewn ileoanal anastomosis and a liver tumor resection were performed. The pathology of the resected specimen confirmed the diagnosis of HCA containing HCC. Five cases of HCA have been reported that developed in patients with FAP, but this is the first case of HCA containing HCC. Hepatocellular adenomas occur due to the inactivation of hepatic nuclear factor 1α, but the mechanism underlying the malignant transformation from HCA to HCC could not be identified in this case.",

    "Abstract": "Pigment deposition is occasionally seen in hepatocellular adenomas. Several reports suggest that pigmented hepatocellular adenomas have increased risk of malignancy, but these tumors remain incompletely understood. To determine the frequency of pigment deposition, we evaluated and classified 109 well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasms that were originally diagnosed or submitted in consultation as hepatocellular adenomas and found 27 (25%) pigmented tumors. All were negative on iron stain and in three cases electron microscopy confirmed the pigment was lipofuscin. The lipofuscin intensely stained with glypican-3 in most cases (89%). Of the 27 pigmented tumors, 11 cases (41%) were classified as hepatocellular adenomas, 7 cases (27%) were classified as atypical hepatocellular adenomas/hepatocellular neoplasms of uncertain malignant potential, and 9 cases (33%) were reclassified as well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas. Four (of 9) hepatocellular carcinomas arose in pigmented hepatocellular adenomas, giving a rate of malignant transformation in pigmented hepatocellular adenomas of 27%. Of the total 27 pigmented tumors, 78% were in women and 22% in men, but interestingly only men had tumors classified as hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatocellular neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential. Also of note, a total of 10 individuals (37%) had multiple hepatocellular neoplasms but in 9 of these cases the other adenomas were non-pigmented. Importantly, in cases with multiple hepatocellular neoplasms, only the pigmented hepatocellular neoplasms had atypia or malignancy. Genotype-phenotype classification of the pigmented tumors showed different subtypes: HNF1α inactivated (48%), β-catenin activated (26%), inflammatory (15%), concurrently β-catenin activated and inflammatory in 1 hepatocellular adenoma, concurrently HNF-1α inactivated and β-catenin activated in 1 hepatocellular adenoma, and unclassified in 1 hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, hepatocellular adenomas with lipofuscin pigment are a heterogeneous group of adenomas, with HNF-1α inactivation being the commonest genotype. They have an increased risk of atypia and malignancy, especially in males.",

    "Abstract": "In 1985, adenomatosis, a term coined to mean ten or more nodules, was considered as a specific entity different from hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) whether single or multiple. In the 2000s the term has lost its individuality. The great contribution of the classification was to clearly demonstrate that in all hepatocellular subtypes and in particular etiologies such as glycogenosis and male hormone administration, HCA could be solitary, multiple (<10) or multiple (>10: adenomatosis). Management of hepatocellular adenomatosis may not be different from solitary or multiple HCA. To keep its specificity in terms of management and prognosis compared to solitary or multiple HCA, it is necessary to indicate the number of nodules including the combination of three parameters: size, location and subtypes. When the classical armentarium to treat nodules is not possible or too risky, embolization or liver transplantation remains the only therapeutic options.",

    "Abstract": "Preoperative imaging and histopathology, immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis after resection of 2 hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) (20 and 2cm) in a 53-year-old female patient were performed. On imaging, the large lesion resembled a myxoid HCA, while the small lesion resembled a more conventional HCA with a small myxoid/fluid area. On microscopy, the large lesion showed cords and nests of hepatocytes embedded in abundant myxoid matrix, while the small lesion resembled a conventional HCA with small foci of myxoid change and serosities; both consistent with a myxoid HCA. Immunophenotyping and molecular subtyping excluded inflammatory HCA, CTNNB1 mutated HCA and sonic hedgehog HCA, and was consistent with HNF1A mutated HCA. The myxoid change as well as the serosities may allow imaging diagnosis of myxoid HCA. As fluid vacuoles can also be present in ASS1+HCA, sonic hedgehog HCA has to be considered in the differential diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenomas are rare benign nodules developed mainly in women taking oral contraceptives. They are solitary or multiple. Their size is highly variable. There is no consensus in the literature for their management except that once their size exceeds 5 cm nodules are taken out to prevent 2 major complications: bleeding and malignant transformation. There are exceptions particularly in men where it is recommended to remove smaller nodules. Since the beginning of this century, major scientific contributions have unveiled the heterogeneity of the disease. HCA are composed of four major subtypes. HNF1A (coding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a) inactivating mutations (H-HCA); inflammatory adenomas (IHCA); the β-catenin-mutated HCAs (β-HCA) and unclassified HCA (UHCA) occurring in 30-40%, 40-50%, 10-15% and 10% of all HCA, respectively. Half of β-HCAs are also inflammatory (β-IHCA). Importantly, β-catenin mutations are associated with a high risk of malignant transformation. HCA subtypes can be identified on liver tissue, including biopsies using specific immunomarkers with a good correspondence with molecular data. Recent data has shown that TERT promoter mutation was a late event in the malignant transformation of β-HCA, β-IHCA. Furthermore, in addition to β-catenin exon 3 mutations, other mutations do exist (exon 7 and 8) with a lower risk of malignant transformation. With these new scientific informations, we have the tools to better know the natural history of the different subtypes, in terms of growth, disappearance, bleeding, malignant transformation and to investigate HCA in diseased livers (vascular diseases, alcoholic cirrhosis). A better knowledge of HCA should lead to a more rational management of HCA. This can be done only if the different subspecialties, including hepatologists, liver pathologists, radiologists and surgeons work altogether in close relationship with molecular biologists. It is a long way to go.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Stopping oral contraceptives following nodule detection usually prevents further hepatocellular growth (HCA); rare cases of growth have been reported after surgery. The aim of the study was to review our resected HCA cases and their outcomes and more specifically, growth. Methods: We retrieved all HCA cases that required a second intervention and HCA growth cases of none resected HCA after resection of one or several HCAs. Results: Out of the 210 resected classified HCA cases, a second resection was performed in 5 cases, 4 of which were in women with HNF1alpha-inactivated adenomatosis (H-adenomatosis) and had a favorable outcome. The fifth case was the occurrence of an inflammatory HCA, 3 years after resection of a previous one. Of the 65 resected HNF1-inactivated HCAs (H-HCAs), the nodules that remained continued to increase very slowly in 3 adenomatosis cases. After surgery, the liver became dysmorphic years later in one case, and the nodules grew but not significantly in another case. After the diagnosis of adenomatosis, progressive growth leads to surgery 12 years later in the last case. Conclusion: These results confirm that, in rare H-adenomatosis, size of nodules may increase very slowly, probably in part through coalescence of micro H-HCAs and leading occasionally to a second resection.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) are the cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) and involved in the development of hepatocellular adenoma and abnormal lipid metabolism. Previously, we have found that the serum microRNA (miR)-122 levels in MODY3 patients were lower than those in type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of decreased miR-122 levels in patients with MODY3 and whether low levels of miR-122 mediate tumorigenesis and abnormal lipid metabolism associated with HNF1α deficiency in human hepatocytes. Methods: The expression of miR-122 was examined by real-time PCR. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the transcriptional regulation of miR-122 by HNF1α. HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNA or miRNA mimic to downregulate or upregulate the expression of HNF1α or miR-122, respectively. CCK-8 and colony formation assay were used to determine cell proliferation. Lipid accumulation was examined by Oil Red O staining and intracellular triglyceride and cholesterol quantification assays. Results: HNF1α regulated the expression of miR-122 by directly binding to its promoter. Knockdown of HNF1α in HepG2 cells reduced the expression of miR-122, increased proliferation and promoted intracellular cholesterol accumulation. Overexpression of miR-122 partially rescued the phenotypes associated with HNF1α deficiency in human hepatocytes. Mechanistically, HNF1α modulated cholesterol homeostasis via miR-122-dependent activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and regulation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Moreover, circulating miR-122 levels were associated with serum cholesterol levels. Conclusion: Loss of HNF1α function led to hepatocyte proliferation and abnormal cholesterol metabolism by downregulating miR-122. Our findings revealed a novel mechanism that low levels of miR-122 mediate tumorigenesis and abnormal lipid metabolism associated with MODY3. MiR-122 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of MODY3.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Through an exploratory proteomic approach based on typical hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), we previously identified a diagnostic biomarker for a distinctive subtype of HCA with high risk of bleeding, already validated on a multicenter cohort. We hypothesized that the whole protein expression deregulation profile could deliver much more informative data for tumor characterization. Therefore, we pursued our analysis with the characterization of HCA proteomic profiles, evaluating their correspondence with the established genotype/phenotype classification and assessing whether they could provide added diagnosis and prognosis values. Approach and results: From a collection of 260 cases, we selected 52 typical cases of all different subgroups on which we built a reference HCA proteomics database. Combining laser microdissection and mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we compared the relative protein abundances between tumoral (T) and nontumoral (NT) liver tissues from each patient and we defined a specific proteomic profile of each of the HCA subgroups. Next, we built a matching algorithm comparing the proteomic profile extracted from a patient with our reference HCA database. Proteomic profiles allowed HCA classification and made diagnosis possible, even for complex cases with immunohistological or genomic analysis that did not lead to a formal conclusion. Despite a well-established pathomolecular classification, clinical practices have not substantially changed and the HCA management link to the assessment of the malignant transformation risk remains delicate for many surgeons. That is why we also identified and validated a proteomic profile that would directly evaluate malignant transformation risk regardless of HCA subtype. Conclusions: This work proposes a proteomic-based machine learning tool, operational on fixed biopsies, that can improve diagnosis and prognosis and therefore patient management for HCAs.",

Our case describes a 66-year-old woman presenting with a palpable mass in her upper abdomen. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a large exophytic mass protruding from the caudal border of liver segments IV and V, without visible metastases. Laparoscopic resection of the tumor and gallbladder was performed. Histopathological examination showed a hepatocellular carcinoma with areas of HNF1a-HCA (H-HCA).

    "Abstract": "Ectopic liver is a very uncommon developmental anomaly that predisposes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe the second documented case of a hepatocellular carcinoma developing in the primary liver of a patient with a rare and uncharacterized genetic symptom complex. Also present was the largest ectopic liver ever reported, measuring 12 cm in diameter which contained a solitary focus of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary hepatocellular carcinoma is believed to have arisen in the native liver from a hepatic adenoma that was diagnosed 15 years earlier. The patient's uncharacterised condition featured prominent thick, yellow skin over the dorsum of the fingers, and was associated with follicular hyperkeratosis, abnormal plantar creases, digital clubbing, misshaped ears, a lingua plicata and an angioleiomyolipoma of the right kidney. This unique case of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from liver cell adenoma in a patient with an uncharacterised condition featuring a large ectopic liver invites discussion of the role of local factors in carcinogenesis in the parent liver but not the ectopic liver. It also underlines the imperative ongoing need for clinical autopsies.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF1β) was initially identified as a liver-specific transcription factor. It is a homeobox transcription factor that functions as a homodimer or heterodimer with HNF1α. HNF1β plays an important role in organogenesis during embryonic stage, especially of the liver, kidney, and pancreas. Mutations in the HNF1β gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5), renal cysts, genital malformations, and pancreas atrophy. Recently, it has been shown that the expression of HNF1β is associated with cancer risk in several tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, renal cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer. HNF1β also regulates the expression of genes associated with stem/progenitor cells, which indicates that HNF1β may play an important role in stem cell regulation. In this review, we discuss some of the current developments about HNF1β and tumor, the relationship between HNF1β and stem/progenitor cells, and the potential pathogenesis of HNF1β in various tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign tumors developed in normal liver most frequently in women before menopause. HCAs lead to diagnostic pitfalls and several difficulties to assess the risk of malignant transformation in these young patients. Recent advances in basic knowledge have revealed a molecular classification related to risk factors, pathological features, and risk of transformation in hepatocellular carcinoma. Three major molecular pathways have been identified altered in specific HCA subgroups that are defined by either (1) inactivation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) transcription factor, (2) activation of the WNT/β-catenin by CTNNB1 mutations, or (3) activation of the IL6/STAT3 pathway by somatic mutation of IL6ST, GNAS, or STAT3. Here, we will review the different molecular classes of HCA.",

    "Abstract": "Age-related degenerative and malignant diseases represent major challenges for health care systems. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and age-associated pathologies is thus of growing biomedical relevance. We identified biallelic germline mutations in SPRTN (also called C1orf124 or DVC1) in three patients from two unrelated families. All three patients are affected by a new segmental progeroid syndrome characterized by genomic instability and susceptibility toward early onset hepatocellular carcinoma. SPRTN was recently proposed to have a function in translesional DNA synthesis and the prevention of mutagenesis. Our in vivo and in vitro characterization of identified mutations has uncovered an essential role for SPRTN in the prevention of DNA replication stress during general DNA replication and in replication-related G2/M-checkpoint regulation. In addition to demonstrating the pathogenicity of identified SPRTN mutations, our findings provide a molecular explanation of how SPRTN dysfunction causes accelerated aging and susceptibility toward carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "Pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is expressed in most tumors. However, whether thyroid hormone (T(3)) and its receptors (TR) regulate PTTG1 in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) remains unclear. Previous cDNA microarrays revealed PTTG1 is down-regulated by T(3)/TR. This study investigated the significance of PTTG1 regulation by T(3) in HCC cells. The PTTG1 mRNA and protein expression were repressed by T(3) in HCC cell lines overexpressing TR. However, after knockdown of TRs expression by RNA interference, PTTG1 repression by T(3) was abolished. Similar results were observed in thyroidectomized rats. To localize the regulatory region in the PTTG1 promoter, serial deletions within the PTTG1 promoter region were constructed. The promoter activity of the PTTG1 gene was repressed (25-51%) by T(3). Additionally, these findings indicate that PTTG1 may be regulated by Sp1. The critical role of the -594 and -520 Sp1 binding sites was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Transfection with Sp1 expression vector enhanced the activity of the PTTG1 promoter fragment reporter. Also, Sp1 was down-regulated in HCC cells and in thyroidectomized rat after T(3) treatment. Additionally, ectopic expression of PTTG1 promotes cell proliferation in Hep3B hepatoma cells. Conversely, knockdown of PTTG1 or Sp1 expression reduced cell proliferation in HepG2 cells. Notably, the expression of PTTG1 and Sp1 was inversely correlated with the expression of TR proteins in HCC. Together, these findings indicate that PTTG1 gene expression is mediated by Sp1 and is indirectly down-regulated by T(3). Finally, overexpression of PTTG1 or SP1 in HCCs is TR-dependent and crucial in the development of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The haplotype frequencies of two closely linked diallelic polymorphisms in the protein C(PROC) gene promoter were determined in the British population. In principle, differences in transcription efficiency between PROC promoter haplotypes could represent an additional risk factor in determining whether or not an individual already predisposed to venous thrombosis will come to clinical attention. In order to explore this postulate, transient transfection of human hepatoma cells with PROC promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs was performed in vitro. In HepG2 cells, the T.....A haplotype exhibited at least a two-fold higher transcription efficiency than the C.....G haplotype. A sample of British protein C deficiency patients with recurrent venous thrombosis was then allelotyped by a combination of oligonucleotide discriminant hybridization and DNA sequencing. The frequency of the low expressing C.....G haplotype was found to be slightly yet not significantly higher in these patients (0.43) than in controls (0.35).",

    "Abstract": "Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is defined by hepatocellular nodules distributed throughout the liver in the absence of fibrous septa between the nodules. Most reports have been single cases so that the prevalence and clinical significance of nodular regenerative hyperplasia is uncertain. In this study, the hepatic histology of 2,500 consecutive autopsies was reviewed. A spectrum of nodular transformation was found with nodular regenerative hyperplasia present in 2.6% of autopsy livers and qualitatively similar but lesser degrees of nodular transformation in a further 10.2%. Nodular transformation was also seen in 47% of livers with cirrhosis and 69% with incomplete cirrhosis. Obliteration of many small portal veins was seen in all cases with nodular regenerative hyperplasia, but only 4.7% of these had evidence of portal hypertension. The prevalence of various clinical states was compared in nodular regenerative hyperplasia and in controls. The results confirm, extend and quantify the spectrum of associated diseases. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia occurs in 5.6% of individuals over age 80 and with increased frequency in patients with systemic arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, massive tumor infiltration and mineral oil deposition. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia appears to be the hepatic analogue of arterial and arteriolar nephrosclerosis. A new classification of nodular transformation is proposed that encompasses the spectrum of lesions described here and the previously defined entities of focal nodular hyperplasia, partial nodular transformation and \"cirrhosis telangiectasia hepatis.\" The major conclusion is that nodular regenerative hyperplasia is a secondary and nonspecific tissue adaptation to heterogeneous distribution of blood flow and does not represent a specific entity.",

Methods: 9 cases of NRH were collected and their clinical and pathological features were reviewed. Results: NRH is an important cause of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension which is frequently associated with autoimmune disease, malignant tumors and administration of certain drugs. Clinically NRH presents portal hypertension, but with almost normal liver function. Pathological examinations found diffuse nodules of hyperplastic hepatocytes in liver without fibrous septa in between. The obliteration of portal veins are frequently seen. This suggests that ischemia caused by alteration of portal veins may play an important role in the development of nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. Conclusion: Histopathology of NRH is characteristic and it should be differentiated from cirrhosis, focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Anhydrous ethanol, for its part, has been successfully used to treat renal cyst, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian chocolate cyst et al. However, in spite of the high frequency of tuberculous purulent pleural effusion, we found that only a few very early studies that attempted to assess the use of intrapleural anhydrous ethanol in tuberculous effusions with signs of empyema. We report a patient who was injected anhydrous ethanol into pleural cavity to treat chronic tuberculous empyema. Case presentation: A 23-year old male was admitted in the hospital because of chronic tuberculous empyema. Ultra-sonography guided thoracentesis and thoracic close drainages were done, but had no effect. However, the patient refused Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) and traditional thoracotomy. Therefore, we injected anhydrous ethanol into the pleural cavity after getting the patient's consent. Pyothorax was quickly controlled and the patient finally recovered fully. Conclusion: Surgical operation is the main treatment of chronic tuberculous empyema, which has a high cost and large injury, and many patients do not accept this treatment. In this study, intrapleural injection of anhydrous ethanol could achieve the purpose of eliminating the pus cavity, which is particularly suitable for patients who cannot tolerate surgery or are unwilling to undergo surgical treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To improve the understanding of hepatic carcinosarcoma (HCS) by analyzing radiological imaging data and clinicopathological features. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on four patients with HCS confirmed immunohistochemically. The analysis included three males and one female, aged 29 to 64 years. Four patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scans, and one underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans simultaneously. Results: Three patients had a history of hepatitis B, cirrhosis or fibrosis, and two patients had schistosomiasis. Two cases tested positive for elevated serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9. The maximum diameters of the lesions ranged from 7.8 to 9.0cm. Pathologically, the carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements in two patients could not be classified, one of the patients had cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) and undifferentiated sarcoma, the other had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). All tumors showed heterogeneous density/intensity, accompanied by vast cystic changes and necrosis, with two cases having cystic septations. Capsule formation was not identified. The margins of the radiological images showed irregular ring enhancement. One case presented continuous progressive enhancement, one case with \"fast in fast washout\" and two cases with \"fast in late washout\". Lymphonodus metastasis, satellite nodules, vascular embolism, and organ invasion (hepatic flexure of the colon) were identified. Conclusion: HCS is a rare, high-grade malignancy with poor prognosis. The preoperative diagnosis is expected to improve by carefully analyzing the imaging features of the patients in combination with their clinical characteristics. Radical resection and postoperative chemoradiotherapy can improve the survival rate of patients.",

    "Abstract": "The great advances in radiologic imaging of the last two decades have focused attention on hepatic nodular lesions. Various entities with a nodular appearance are predominantly composed of hepatocytes or tumor cells of hepatocytic origin, including benign and malignant neoplasms as well as tumorlike lesions. Differential diagnosis of these nodules can often be difficult, especially in the limited material of a needle biopsy specimen. The histological features that can be of help in this regard are the focus of this review. In noncirrhotic livers, differential diagnoses include liver cell adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, large regenerative nodule, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, partial nodular transformation, compensatory hyperplasia, focal fatty change, and well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma must be distinguished from other malignant tumors, especially metastatic, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. In cirrhotic livers, the differential diagnoses include large regenerative nodule, focal fatty change, low-grade dysplastic nodule, high-grade dysplastic nodule, and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Patients with nodular regenerative hyperplasia have signs and symptoms of portal hypertension, without evidence of hepatocellular failure or encephalopathy. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with recurrent esophageal bleeding and refractory ascites who had a history of hemosiderosis, hepatitis C, and chronic renal allograft rejection. Our preoperative diagnosis was cirrhotic end-stage liver disease and end-stage renal disease for which the patient underwent combined hepatic and renal transplantation. Her portal hypertension symptoms resolved, and her renal function has been normal for 18 months of follow-up. Histologic examination of the liver revealed nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and a review of the literature regarding the surgical management of patients with nodular regenerative hyperplasia revealed that various shunting procedures are generally recommended. After the failure of medical management in patients with nodular regenerative hyperplasia, portosystemic shunting may be indicated before proceeding to hepatic transplantation.",

Vascular abnormalities were seen in all cases. The nodules can be explained in all three conditions as a response to a greater blood supply in the nodules as compared to the surrounding parenchyma. In NRH, there appears to be ischemia caused by arteritis and secondary oblitertion of small portal veins. In PNT, ischemia may be caused by portal vein thrombosis. In FNH, there appears to be hyperemia caused by a spiderlike arterial anomaly.",

Methods: The medical records of patients who underwent surgical resection for cHCC-CC at our institution between July 2012 and June 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Results: During the study period, 168 patients, 122 males (72.6%) and 46 females (27.4%), underwent surgical resection for cHCC-CC, including 159 patients (94.6%) who underwent R0 resection. Mean tumor diameter was 4.4 ± 2.8 cm, and 161 patients (95.8%) had solitary tumors. Histologically, 86 patients (51.2%) had classical type, and 82 (48.8%) had tumors with stem cell (SC) features, including 33 (19.6%) with intermediate-cell and 23 (13.7%) each with typical SC and cholangiolocellular features; 3 tumors (1.8%) were unclassifiable. At 1, 3, and 5 years, tumor recurrence rates were 31.9%, 49.6%, and 58.1%, respectively, and patient survival rates were 91.0%, 70.2%, and 60.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that tumor size of >5 cm, microscopic and macroscopic vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor stage, and 2010 WHO classification were significantly prognostic. Multivariate analysis showed that the 8th AJCC tumor stage and 2010 WHO histologic classification were independently prognostic for tumor recurrence and patient survival. There were no significant prognostic differences among the 3 SC subtypes. Conclusion: Postresection outcomes are better in patients with SC-type than with classical-type cHCC-CC.",

High incidence of various malignancies involving lymphoreticular, gastrointestinal and mesenchymal organs have reported in ataxia-telangiectasia. Elevated levels of alpha fetoprotein have been noted commonly in this disorder. In spite of the hepatic histological and biochemical changes associated with elevated alpha fetoprotein, to our knowledge, development of hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core promoter contains a binding site for nuclear receptors. A natural double mutation in this binding site, which changes nucleotide (nt) 1765 from A to T and nt 1767 from G to A, selectively abolishes the binding of several nuclear receptors without affecting that of HNF4. This double mutation also creates a binding site for the transcription factor HNF1 and changes two amino acids in the overlapping X protein sequence. In this study, we have examined the roles of HNF1, HNF4, and the X protein in the regulation of the core promoter activities in Huh7 hepatoma cells. Our results indicate that HNF4 could stimulate the expression of the precore RNA and the core RNA from the core promoter of both the wild-type (WT) HBV and the double mutant, although its effect on the former was more prominent. In contrast, HNF1, which did not affect the WT core promoter, suppressed the precore RNA expression of the double mutant. Further analysis using HBV genomic constructs, with and without the ability to express the X protein, indicates that the X protein did not affect the HNF4 activity on the core promoter and affected the HNF1 activity on the core promoter of only the double mutant. Thus, our results indicate that the phenotypic differences of HBV WT and double-mutant core promoters are at least partially due to the differential activities of HNF1, HNF4, and the X protein on these two promoters.",

    "Abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration is a model of cholestasis. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 4 (Oatp4; Slc21a10) is almost exclusively expressed in liver. Therefore, it was hypothesized that LPS would down-regulate mouse Oatp4 and that this action is due to a decrease in nuclear binding activity of one or more liver-enriched transcription factors to mouse Oatp4 promoter. The present study indicates a time-dependent decrease in mouse Oatp4 mRNA levels by LPS. Moreover, LPS produced a rapid and profound decrease in nuclear binding activity to the mouse Oatp4 putative response elements for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1, CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), HNF3, and heterodimers of retinoid X receptor (RXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Maximal decrease in nuclear binding activity to these response elements preceded a significant reduction of Oatp4 mRNA levels. HNF1alpha bound to the Oatp4 HNF1 response element as a homodimer. Multiple copies of the Oatp4 HNF1alpha response element, inserted upstream of a minimal promoter, were sufficient to mediate reporter activity and responded to the coexpression of HNF1alpha in mouse hepatoma cells. Moreover, HNF1alpha dose dependently activated the Oatp4 promoter (-4.8 kilo-bases to +30 bp). Therefore, HNF1alpha is a potent trans-activator of the mouse Oatp4 promoter. In addition, Oatp4 mRNA levels were markedly decreased (95%) in HNF1alpha-null mice as compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that HNF1alpha levels are critical for the constitutive expression of the Oatp4 gene. Taken together, these findings suggest that the LPS-induced down-regulation of Oatp4 is likely due to reduction in the binding of HNF1alpha, C/EBP, HNF3, and RXR:RAR to the Oatp4 promoter.",

The present study aimed to determine whether genetic variation in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is associated with the development and/or progression of HCC and the survival of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC. Design and methods: We assessed seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the AXIN1, AXIN2, CTNNB1, and WNT2 genes in 245 patients with HBV-associated HCC and 483 chronic HBV carriers without HCC. We analyzed the association of each SNP with HCC development or progression and overall survival. Results: The CTNNB1 rs3864004 A allele was associated with a decreased risk of HCC development (P=0.049). Haplotype analysis revealed a significantly higher frequency of CTNNB1 G-A/G-A haplotype at rs3864004 and rs4135385 positions in patients with HCC than in chronic HBV carriers without HCC (P=0.042). The AXIN1 rs1805105 T>C SNP was associated with small tumor size and early tumor stage and the WNT2 rs39315 G allele was associated with advanced tumor stage in HCC. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, carriers of the AXIN1 rs214252 C allele showed longer survival than those with the TT genotype (P=0.020). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, absence of CTNNB1 haplotype A-A at rs3864004 and rs4135385 positions and advanced tumor stage were independent poor predictors of patient survival in patients with HCC. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the genetic polymorphisms in CTNNB1 gene might affect tumor development and survival in patients with HBV-associated HCC.",

The prevalence and clinical significance of CTNNB1 mutations in advanced HCC remain unclear. Methods: Patients with advanced HCC and available pathologic tissues (either obtained when diagnosed at advanced or early stages) were enrolled in this study. Direct sequencing of exon 3 of CTNNB1 was performed to detect somatic mutations. The associations between CTNNB1 mutations and clinicopathologic features were analyzed. Results: A total of 115 patients were enrolled, among whom 78 (67.8%) had chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Twenty-one (18.3%) patients were found to have CTNNB1 mutations, all of which were missense mutations. The CTNNB1 mutation rates were similar among pathologic tissues obtained at advanced and early stages (17.5 and 20.0%, respectively). Patients aged over 60 years were more likely to have CTNNB1 mutations than patients younger than 60 years (32.6 vs. 8.7%, p = 0.001). The mutations were not associated with survival or other clinicopathologic features. Conclusion: In patients with advanced HCC, CTNNB1 mutations were not prognostically significant. No apparent increase of CTNNB1 mutations occurred during the progression of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The presented study is devoted to investigation of molecular mechanisms regulating alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene expression at transcriptional level. The study was carried out on AFP-positive and AFP-negative clones of rat hepatoma McA-RH 7777 that also differ in hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF) 1 and 4 transcription levels. To examine a hypothesis of existence in AFP-non-producing clones a transcriptional factor that downregulates this gene expression, we have obtained somatic hybrids of AFP-positive and AFP-negative clones. In the obtained hybrids AFP gene expression is decreased while expression of HNF1, one of the main AFP promoter activators, is maintained. These data indicate an existence of a repressor in AFP-negative clones that determines AFP gene downregulation regardless of the HNF1 expression level.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) remains a disease of poor prognosis, highlighting the relevance of elucidating key molecular aberrations that may be targeted for novel therapies. Wnt signalling activation, chiefly due to mutations in CTNNB1, have been identified in a major subset of HCC patients. While several in vitro proof of concept studies show the relevance of suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signalling in HCC cells or tumour xenograft models, no study has addressed the impact of β-catenin inhibition in a relevant murine HCC model driven by Ctnnb1 mutations. Methods: We studied the in vivo impact of β-catenin suppression by locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense treatment, after establishing Ctnnb1 mutation-driven HCC by diethylnitrosamine and phenobarbital (DEN/PB) administration. Results: The efficacy of LNA directed against β-catenin vs. scrambled on Wnt signalling was demonstrated in vitro in HCC cells and in vivo in normal mice. The DEN/PB model leads to HCC with Ctnnb1 mutations. A complete therapeutic response in the form of abrogation of HCC was observed after ten treatments of tumour-bearing mice with β-catenin LNA every 48h as compared to the scrambled control. A decrease in β-catenin activity, cell proliferation and increased cell death was evident after β-catenin suppression. No effect of β-catenin suppression was evident in non-Ctnnb1 mutated HCC, observed after DEN-only administration. Conclusions: Thus, we provide the in vivo proof of concept that β-catenin suppression in HCC will be of significant therapeutic benefit, provided the tumours display Wnt activation via mechanisms like CTNNB1 mutations.",

    "Abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is expressed primarily in the liver, kidney, and uterus. Basal IGFBP-1 promoter activity in human HEP G2 hepatoma cells is dependent upon a proximal promoter element that binds hepatic nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), a protein that is likely to be an important factor regulating the expression of many genes in liver and kidney. To test whether HNF1 activates IGFBP-1 transcription, HEP G2 cells and HeLa cells were cotransfected transiently with HNF1 expression vectors and with IGFBP-1 promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs. HNF1 increased IGFBP-1 promoter activity in both HEP G2 and HeLa cells. Gel mobility-shift assays and additional transfections in HeLa cells showed that expressed full-length and carboxy-terminal truncated forms of HNF1 could each bind the HNF1 cis element of the IGFBP-1 promoter; however, significant trans-activation only occurred in the presence of the full-length HNF1 protein, similar to past experience with these two HNF1 forms and the albumin promoter. Further studies showed that IGFBP-1 promoter constructs containing mutations with high or low affinity for HNF1 responded to HNF1 expression with increased or decreased activity, respectively, relative to the native promoter. These studies suggest that HNF1 and/or related proteins play a role in hepatic, and perhaps also renal, expression of IGFBP-1.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To comprehensively understand the underlying molecular events accounting for aberrant Wnt signaling activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: This study was retrospective. The HCC tissue specimens used in this research were obtained from patients who underwent liver surgery. The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database was searched for the mutation statuses of CTNNB1, TP53, and protein degradation regulator genes of CTNNB1. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed with TOP/FOP reporters to detect whether TP53 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations could enhance the transcriptional activity of Wnt signaling. Methylation sensitive restriction enzyme-quantitative PCR was used to explore the methylation status of CpG islands located in the promoters of APC, SFRP1, and SFRP5 in HCCs with different risk factors. Finally, nested-reverse transcription PCR was performed to examine the integration of HBx in front of LINE1 element and the existence of HBx-LINE1 chimeric transcript in Hepatitis B virus-related HCC. All results in this article were analyzed with the software SPSS version 19.0 for Windows, and different groups were compared by χ(2) test as appropriate. Results: Based on the data from COSMIC database, compared with other solid tumors, mutation frequency of CTNNB1 was significantly higher in HCC (P < 0.01). The rate of CTNNB1 mutation was significantly less frequent in Hepatitis B virus-related HCC than in other etiologies (P < 0.01). Dual-luciferase reporter system and TOP/FOP reporter assays confirmed that TP53 GOF mutants were able to enhance the transcriptional ability of Wnt signaling. An exclusive relationship between the status of TP53 and CTNNB1 mutations was observed. However, according to the COSMIC database, TP53 GOF mutation is rare in HCC, which indicates that TP53 GOF mutation is not a reason for the aberrant activation of Wnt signaling in HCC. APC and AXIN1 were mutated in HCC. By using methylation sensitive restriction enzyme-quantitative PCR, hypermethylation of APC was detected in HCC with different risk factors, whereas SFRP1 and SFRP5 were not hypermethylated in any of the HCC etiologies, which indicates that the mutation of APC and AXIN1, together with the methylation of APC could take part in the overactivation of Wnt signaling. Nested-reverse transcription PCR failed to detect the integration of HBx before the LINE1 element, or the existence of an HBx-LINE1 chimeric transcript, suggesting that integration could not play a role in the aberrant activation of Wnt signaling in HCC. Conclusion: In HCC, genetic/epigenetic aberration of CTNNB1 and its protein degradation regulators are the major cause of Wnt signaling overactivation.",

We report the cloning and characterization of a rat genomic DNA fragment containing about 3.5 kb of the LFB1/HNF1 gene 5'-flanking region. This DNA segment is capable of directing the liver-specific expression of a reporter gene in transfection assays. More interestingly, the basal activity of the LFB1/HNF1 promoter in cultured hepatoma cell lines is down-regulated by exogenously added LFB1/HNF1 protein itself. The ability to repress transcription starting from its own promoter requires the integrity of the N-terminal LFB1/HNF1 DNA-binding domain. Contrary to the expectations, in vitro binding experiments failed to demonstrate any specific and functional interaction of purified LFB1/HNF1 with the -3.5 kb promoter sequence. In addition to the DNA-binding domain, a 60 aa region contained in the C-terminus of the protein and distinct from the previously characterized activation domains, is also required for the repressing function.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Recently, abnormal activation of the Wnt pathway has been found to be involved in the carcinogenesis of HCC. However, the relationship between genetic changes in the Wnt pathway-associated genes and its protein expression has not been studied in patients with HCC and cirrhotic nodules. The purpose of this study is to explore the contribution of inappropriate activation of the Wnt pathway in liver carcinogenesis. Methods: Somatic mutation in exons 3-5 of AXIN1 and exon 3 of beta-catenin were analyzed by direct sequencing and expression of axin and beta-catenin proteins by immunohistochemistry in a series of 36 patients with HCC and cirrhosis. Results: The AXIN1 and beta-catenin gene mutations were observed in 25% (9/36) and 2.8% (1/36) of HCCs, respectively. All mutations detected in AXIN1 and beta-catenin genes were missense point mutations. Abnormal nuclear expression of beta-catenin was observed in 11 of 36 cases of HCCs (30.6%), but not in cirrhotic nodules. Reduced or absent expression of axin was seen in 24 of 36 HCCs (66.7%). The abnormal expression of beta-catenin and axin proteins was closely correlated with mutations of AXIN1 and beta-catenin (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.008, respectively). Conclusions: These data suggest that mutation of AXIN1 gene is a frequent and late event for HCC associated with cirrhosis, and is correlated significantly with abnormal expression of axin and beta-catenin. Therefore, activation of Wnt signaling through AXIN1 rather than beta-catenin mutation might play an important role in liver carcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "HNF1 is a transcriptional activator, required for the liver-specific expression of a variety of genes, that binds to DNA as a dimer via the most diverged homeodomain known so far. We were interested to examine whether HNF1 is a unique homeoprotein example or whether it is the prototype of a new subfamily of homeodomain containing proteins. In this work we describe the isolation of a cDNA clone from a human liver library encoding a protein, highly homologous to HNF1 in three regions, including the homeo- and dimerization domains. We show that this protein can heterodimerize with human HNF1 in vitro. Sequence comparison of our clone with a rat variant HNF1 (vHNF1) clone, isolated in parallel in our laboratory from the dedifferentiated H5 hepatoma cell line, identified our cDNA as human vHNF1. vHNF1 is a nuclear protein recognizing the same binding site as HNF1 and previously thought to occur only in dedifferentiated hepatoma cells that fail to express most liver specific genes. Nevertheless, we show by Northern blot analysis that vHNF1 transcripts are present in differentiated human HepG2 hepatoma cells as well as in rat liver and that this transcript level is 10-20 fold lower than that of HNF1. We assigned the vHNF-1 gene to human chromosome 17 and murine chromosome 11. These chromosomal localizations differ from that of the HNF-1 gene indicating that both genes are not clustered on the genome.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer diagnosed worldwide. Deregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has been associated with the development of HCC in a substantial number of cases in Europe and far less in Asia. Nothing is known about this pathway in HCC cases from South America. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of mutations in beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) and the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in HCC cases from Colombia. Material and methods: We determine by direct sequencing the frequency of mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1 gene and by immunohistochemistry the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in 54 samples of HCC obtained from three pathology units in Bogota and Medellin cities. Results: Only three HCC cases (5.6%) were found mutated at residues (G34E, S45P, P44S, T41I) important for phosphorylation and ubiquitination of beta-catenin protein. Strikingly, nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation of beta-catenin, hallmark of Wnt pathway activation, was found in 42.6% HCC cases (23/54). Interestingly, beta-catenin accumulation was significantly more frequent in young patients and hepatitis B virus-related HCC. Conclusions: Although, CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations are not frequent in HCC from Colombian patients, our findings indicate that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is activated in 42.6% of HCC samples. Furthermore, Wnt signaling was demonstrated in HCC cases associated of HBV infection, one of the most important HCC risk factors in Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "CTNNB1 mutations activating ß-catenin are frequent somatic events in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adenoma (HCA), particularly associated with a risk of malignant transformation. We aimed to understand the relationship between CTNNB1 mutation types, tumor phenotype, and level of ß-catenin activation in malignant transformation. To this purpose, CTNNB1 mutation spectrum was analyzed in 220 HCAs, 373 HCCs, and 17 borderline HCA/HCC lesions. ß-catenin activation level was assessed in tumors by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC), in cellulo by TOP-Flash assay. Overall, ß-catenin activity was higher in malignant mutated tumors, compared to adenomas, and this was related to a different spectrum of CTNNB1 mutations in HCCs and HCAs. In benign tumors, we defined three levels of ß-catenin activation related to specific mutations: (1) S45, K335, and N387 mutations led to weak activation; (2) T41 mutations were related to moderate activity; and (3) highly active mutations included exon 3 deletions and amino acid substitutions within the ß-TRCP binding site (D32-S37). Accordingly, in vitro, K335I and N387K mutants showed a lower activity than S33C. Tumors with highly active mutations demonstrated strong/homogeneous glutamine synthase (GS) staining and were associated with malignancy. In contrast, weak mutants demonstrated heterogeneous pattern of GS staining and were more frequent in HCAs except for the S45 mutants identified similarly in 20% of mutated HCAs and HCCs; however, in most of the HCCs, the weak S45 mutant alleles were duplicated, resulting in a final high ß-catenin activity. Conclusion: High ß-catenin activity driven by specific CTNNB1 mutations and S45 allele duplication is associated with malignant transformation. Consequently, HCAs with S45 and all high/moderate mutants should be identified with precise IHC criteria or mutation screening. (Hepatology 2016;64:2047-2061).",

    "Abstract": "Two widely used hepatoma cell lines, mouse BW1J and human HepG2, express gene products characteristic of fetal hepatocytes, including serum albumin, whereas reporter genes driven by the albumin promoter are expressed at very low levels compared with highly differentiated hepatoma cells. We have investigated the low albumin promoter activity in BW1J cells to understand differences in liver gene regulation between fetal and adult cells. Addition of the albumin upstream enhancer, or any other fragment of the albumin gene, failed to modify expression of the transfected promoter in BW1J cells. Analysis of cis elements of the albumin promoter showed that, in contrast to highly differentiated H4II cells, in BW1J cells the activity largely depends on ubiquitous transcription factors. Both BW1J and HepG2 cells produce the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF1; dimerization and DNA binding properties are identical to those of liver HNF1, yet the protein fails to show the anticipated transcriptional stimulatory activity. A transfected HNF1 expression vector strongly trans-activates the albumin promoter in HepG2 but only weakly in BW1J cells, and in hybrids (BW1J x Fao), inefficient HNF1 function is dominant. We conclude that hepatoma cells of the fetal phenotype are deficient in the use of HNF1 to drive transcription of the albumin gene and that they harbor a dominant modulator of HNF1 function.",

    "Abstract": "Liver-enriched factor LFB1 (also named HNF1) is a dimeric transcription activator which is essential for the expression of many hepatocyte-specific genes. Here we demonstrate that LFB1 mutants in the POU A-like or in the homeo domains inhibit wild-type DNA binding by forming inactive heterodimeric complexes. Co-transfection of one of these mutants with wild-type LFB1 in HeLa cells eliminated LFB1 DNA binding and transcriptional activities through a trans-dominant mechanism. Expression of the same dominant negative mutant in human hepatoma HepG2 cells only partially inhibited endogenous LFB1 activity, due to stabilization of LFB1 dimers in these cells. Dimer stabilization in hepatoma cells is mediated by a heat-labile association with an 11kD polypeptide, analogous to the DCoH cofactor identified in rat liver by Mendel et al. (1). The property of stabilizing LFB1 dimers is also shared by HeLa cells which produce a HeLa homolog of DCoH. These results demonstrate that LFB1 dimer stabilization as well as the synthesis of 'stabilizing factors' are not restricted to cells expressing LFB1 or other members of its family.",

Methods: Two-hundred and fifty HCV4a patients, 224 HCV4a-HCC patients, and 84 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Expression levels of miR214-5p, miR-125b, miR-1269 and miR-375 were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Expression of the selected miRNAs in serum was significantly lower in HCC patients than in the healthy controls, except for miR-1269 and miR-494. There was a significant difference between HCC and HCV patients, in particular for HCC and late stage fibrosis, rather than HCV patients and early fibrosis. It is obvious that miR-1269 was significantly upregulated in HCC cases compared to hepatic fibrosis cases. Each miRNA can show HCC progression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the tested panel of miRNAs (miR214-5p, miR-125b, miR-1269 and miR-375) represent accurate and specific indictors of HCC development. Conclusion: This study presents a panel of miRNAs with strong power as putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HCV-induced HCC. Moreover, miR-214-5p and miR-1269 could be considered as early biomarkers for tracking the progress of liver fibrosis to HCC.",

Our single-center experience reveals no statistical difference in both short- and long-term prognosis of HCC patients after laparoscopic liver resection (LLR), regardless of whether they suffer from PHT, which is consistent with previous studies on the use of LLR for HCC with PHT. Retrieval outcomes indicate existence of short- and long-term prognostic superiority, following laparoscopic treatment, relative to non-laparoscopic treatment. Besides that, LLR offers long-term prognostic advantage compared to laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation. In addition, we review the previous literature and propose corresponding perspectives on the therapy of hypersplenism, the utilization of Pringle maneuver, and the adoption of anatomical hepatectomy during radical laparoscopic treatment. HCC with PHT is not the \"forbidden zone\" of radical laparoscopic treatment. However, patients' preoperative liver function should be adequately estimated.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Extrahepatic metastasis (EHM) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in 10%-15% of cases following initial treatment. The most frequent sites of EHM are the lung, lymph nodes, and bone. Gastrointestinal or brain metastasis from HCC is rarely reported. Here, we report a rare case of concurrent HCC metastases to the stomach, colon, and brain. Case summary: A 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol induced HCC presented with multiple intrahepatic recurrences and tumorous lesions in the stomach and ascending colon. Three years earlier, he underwent right hemihepatectomy, and 1 year ago, he had a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection for pulmonary metastasis of HCC. We decided on surgical resection of the new metastases because of massive gastric bleeding and concern for possible colonic obstruction. The patient underwent gastric wedge resection and right hemicolectomy. Two weeks later, the patient developed dysarthria and mild cognitive disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a left frontal lobe lesion, and he underwent resection of a metastatic brain tumor. Unfortunately, he died 6 weeks after the last surgery due to hepatorenal syndrome. Conclusion: Decision of surgery was carefully recommended in this case and may extend survival in other metastatic HCC patients with well-preserved hepatic function.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Transferrin (Tf) exerts a crucial function in the maintenance of systemic iron homeostasis. The expression of the Tf gene is controlled by transcriptional mechanism, although little is known about genetic factors influence. Objective: To study the role of rs3811647 in Tf expression using an in-vitro assay on hepatoma cells. Design and methods: Hep3B cells were co-transfected with constructs containing A (VarA-Tf-luc) and G (VarG-Tf-luc) variants of rs3811647, using luciferase as a surrogate reporter of Tf expression. Results: Luciferase assays showed a higher intrinsic enhancer activity (p < 0.05) in the A compared with the G variant. In silico analysis of SNP rs3811647 showed that the A allele might constitute a binding site for the transcription factor glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Conclusion: The A allele of SNP rs3811647 increases Tf expression in a manner that might underlie inter-individual variation in serum transferrin levels observed in different population groups.",

    "Abstract": "The transthyretin (TTR) gene is regulated by two DNA regions which elicit hepatocyte-specific expression: a proximal promoter and distal enhancer. The TTR promoter and enhancer are composed of at least eight DNA binding sites for three different hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), and AP-1/cJun. Site directed mutations within each of the HNF binding sites in the TTR promoter were introduced to evaluate their contribution to transcriptional activity in hepatoma cells. The data indicate that the strong affinity HNF-3-S binding site (-106 to -94) is absolutely required for TTR promoter activity since several mutations in this site eliminate TTR expression in the context of its enhancer. Conversion of a second weak affinity HNF3-W site (-140 to -131) in the TTR promoter to a high affinity site resulted in higher levels of expression. TTR mutations that disrupted several weak affinity sites (HNF1, HNF3-W, and HNF4) only slightly diminished expression levels in the presence of the TTR enhancer. In contrast, when we deleted the TTR enhancer from these HNF mutant constructs, TTR expression decreased to undetectable levels. This result suggests cooperation between the factors binding to the TTR promoter and enhancer regions. These results also demonstrate that the HNF3-S site alone is not sufficient to activate TTR transcription, but rather requires the participation of three cell-specific factors to elicit minimal promoter activity. The complexity of this promoter design and the requirement for a minimal number of cell-specific factors to achieve transcription allows us to propose a model which may explain the maintenance of tissue-specific expression of TTR.",

    "Abstract": "Sotos syndrome (SoS, OMIM#117550) is an overgrowth disorder characterized by excessive growth-especially in the first years of childhood-distinctive craniofacial features, and various degrees of mental retardation. Haploinsufficiency of the nuclear receptor binding SET domain containing protein 1 (NSD1) gene, due to either intragenic mutations or whole-gene microdeletions, is found in the majority of patients with SoS. However, in approximately 10-40% of patients with a typical SoS phenotype, no abnormalities are detected. In this study, hemizygous hypermethylation or genomic sequence abnormalities of the promoter region of NSD1 were hypothesized to be the underlying cause in patients with a SoS phenotype, but without confirmed NSD1 alterations. In 18 patients, including one patient with a reported hepatocellular carcinoma, the promoter region of NSD1 was analyzed. However, no hypermethylation or sequence abnormalities in the promoter region could be detected. It therefore seems unlikely that such abnormalities of NSD1 are a major culprit in patients with phenotypical SoS. Additional methods are necessary for detection of other genetic or epigenetic causes of SoS.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rarely occurs in childhood. We describe a patient with new onset of pruritus at 8 months of age who at 17 months of age was found to have a 2.5 cm HCC. To delineate the possible genetic basis of this tumour, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of the germline DNA and identified two novel predictably deleterious missense mutations in ABCB11, encoding bile salt export pump (BSEP), confirmed in the parental DNA as bi-allelic and inherited. Although inherited ABCB11 mutations have previously been linked to HCC in a small number of cases, the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis in ABCB11 disease are unknown. WES of the HCC tissue uncovered somatic driver mutations in the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and nuclear-factor-erythroid-2-related-factor-2 (NFE2L2) genes. Moreover, clonality analysis predicted that the CTNNB1 mutation was clonal and occurred earlier during carcinogenesis, whereas the NFE2L2 mutation was acquired later. Interestingly, background liver parenchyma showed no inflammation or fibrosis and BSEP expression was preserved. This is the first study to identify somatic CTNNB1 and NFE2L2 mutations in early childhood arisen in the setting of inherited bi-allelic ABCB11 mutations. Rapid WES analysis expedited this child's diagnosis and treatment, and likely improved her prognosis.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Genetic analysis has revealed a subset of recurrently mutated genes and aberrant cellular signaling pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma. To investigate genetic alterations and dysregulated pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma, we performed targeted sequencing and exome analysis using next-generation sequencer. Methods: We analyzed the somatic mutational profiles of 16 genes in primary hepatocellular carcinoma by targeted ultra-deep sequencing using nine pairs of specimens (tumor and peripheral blood) and whole-exome sequencing using one pair of samples. Results: Overall, somatic mutations with high allele fraction were identified in tumor tissues by targeted deep sequencing. Somatic mutations with high allele fraction were observed in TP53 (3/9; 33%) and CTNNB1 (2/9; 22%) genes in five out of nine (55%) specimens. In vitro analysis showed that CTNNB1 H36P mutant protein identified in tumor samples was resistant to protein degradation and promoted cell proliferation. Exome sequencing identified SLIT3 mutation, implying that dysregulation of axon guidance genes is involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. These results showed that TP53 and WNT/β-catenin signaling pathways were commonly mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: These results suggest that targeted sequencing and exome sequencing enable the identification of putative oncogenic driver mutations during the development of hepatocarcinoma.",

A strong rise in expression of HNF-4 isoforms alpha2, alpha4 and gamma correlates with commitment into highly differentiated enterocyte-like phenotype of Caco-2 cells which best mimic enterocytes, whereas only isoform alpha4 expression is high in the less differentiated HT-29 G- cells. These increased expressions are not encountered in the highly differentiated mucous-secreting HT-29 MTX cells. Differentiation into highly specialized enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells and mucous-secreting HT-29 MTX cells is accompanied by a moderate rise in HNF-1 without change in the ratio of its variants. Our data corroborate those of Spath et al. (Mol. Cell. Biol., 1997, 17, 1913) in hepatoma cells and suggest that HNF-4 isoforms alpha2, alpha4 and gamma play a major role in the differentiation of enterocytes.",

    "Abstract": "Several sequence changes have been reported in hereditary angioedema patients in intron 2 of the SERPING1/C1NH gene, but their consequences on splicing have not been determined. We examined in cell transfection assays the consequences at the mRNA level of splicing mutations affecting either the +3 or the +5 donor site positions, or the conserved canonical splicing signals of exon 2, using mutant C1 inhibitor minigene constructs. Both intron 2 mutations, c.51+3A>G and c.51+5G>A, resulted in marked exon 2 skipping in these assays, but also yielded a large fraction of normal transcripts. We show that the c.51+3A>G mutation cosegregates with low C1 inhibitor protein levels in one family. Moreover, the second base of exon 2 of the SERPING1/C1NH gene is the site of a polymorphic variant, which has been proposed as a modifier of disease severity. We found that the c.-21C allele at this position yields low but significant levels of exon 2 skipping in transfected Hep G2 or Hep 3B cells, suggesting that this allele may contribute, at the RNA level, to more severe forms of angioedema. Furthermore, we describe a previously not detected alternative splicing of exon 3, found in peripheral blood cell mRNA but not in the liver or in hepatoma cell lines and we show that, in cultured monocytes of a patient carrying the c.51+3A>G mutation, this alternative splicing is shifted from exon 3 exclusion to skipping of both exons 2 and 3. The latter finding suggests that mutations affecting splicing of exon 2 of the SERPING1/C1NH gene may have different consequences in monocytes versus other cell types.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/aims: The prognosis of hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis is worse than in those without cirrhosis. In Korea, the hepatitis B virus prevalence rate is higher than in other countries. Therefore, we investigated patients' clinicopathologic and metabolic factors that affect the postoperative outcomes of hepatic resection for HCC in our hospital in Korea. Methods: From August 2000 to December 2012, 171 HCC patients underwent hepatic resections at our institution. Two operative mortality cases and two short-term follow up cases were excluded. Data was collected from a retrospective chart review. There were 133 males (79.6%) and 34 females (20.3%), with a mean age of 58.2±10.2 years (range, 22-81 years), and the relationship between clinicopathologic and metabolic factors and the prognosis of patients with HCC undergoing hepatic resection were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Hypertension, major surgery, perioperative transfusion, resection with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation, and resection margin were risk factors for overall survival, and hypertension, albumin, resection with RFA or cryoablation, perioperative transfusion, and tumor size were risk factors for disease-free survival. Conclusions: We found that hypertension, perioperative transfusion, and resection with RFA or cryoablation were risk factors for both disease-free and overall survival after hepatic resection in HCC patients. Further study is required to clarify the influence of metabolic and other clinicopathologic factors on the prognosis of HCC.",

We report a unique case of hepatoblastoma in a 19-month-old female with an unusual/atypical small cell undifferentiated component with ARID1A and beta-catenin mutations. It had an aggressive clinical course despite treatment, with metastases to the left psoas muscle, perihepatic and paratracheal lymph nodes, spinal cord, and leptomeninges. Leptomeningeal metastases resulted in diffuse cerebral edema and death. The initial diagnostic biopsy did not reveal rhabdoid cells while all metastatic foci showed cells with rhabdoid morphology in the autopsy specimens. Although this rhabdoid component resembled malignant rhabdoid tumor morphologically, molecular analyses failed to show mutations or deletions of SMARCB1.",

    "Abstract": "China accounts for almost half of the total number of liver cancer cases and deaths worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most primary liver cancer. Snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2) is known as an epithelial to mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factor that drives neoplastic epithelial cells into mesenchymal phenotype. However, the roles of endogenous SNAI2 remain controversial in different types of malignant tumors. Herein, we surprisingly identify that anchorage-independent growth, including the formation of tumor sphere and soft agar colony, is significantly increased when SNAI2 expression is inhibited by shRNAs in HCC cells. Suppression of SNAI2 suffices to up-regulate several cancer stem genes. Although unrelated to the metastatic ability, SNAI2 inhibition does increase the efflux of Hoechst 33342 and enhance multidrug resistance in vitro and in vivo. In agreement with this data, we demonstrate for the first time that decreasing SNAI2 level can transcriptionally upregulate several ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes such as ABCB1. Moreover, ABC transporters' inhibitor verapamil can rescue the multidrug resistance induced by SNAI2 inhibition. Our results implicate that SNAI2 behaves as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting multidrug resistance via suppressing ABC transporter genes in HCC cells.",

We compared prognostic performances of LS and FIB-4 to predict HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Data from 1308 patients with CHB, who underwent TE, were retrospectively analyzed. FIB-4 was calculated for all patients. The cumulative rate of HCC development was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. The predictive performances of LS and FIB-4 were evaluated using time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves.The mean age (883 men) was 50 years. During follow-up (median 6.1 years), 119 patients developed HCC. The areas under the ROC curves (AUROCs) predicting HCC risk at 3, 5, and 7 years were consistently greater for LS than for FIB-4 (0.791-0.807 vs 0.691-0.725; all P < 0.05). Similarly, when the respective AUROCs for LS and FIB-4 at every time point during the 7-year follow-up were plotted, LS also showed consistently better performance than FIB-4 after 1 year of enrollment. The combined use of LS and FIB-4 significantly enhanced the prognostic performance compared with the use of FIB-4 alone (P < 0.05), but the performance of the combined scores was statistically similar to that of LS alone (P > 0.05).LS showed significantly better performance than FIB-4 in assessing the risk of HCC development, and the combined use of LS and FIB-4 did not provide additional benefit compared with the use of LS alone. Hence, LS assessed using TE might be helpful for optimizing HCC surveillance strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Europeans and American Indians were major genetic ancestry of Hispanics in the U.S. These ancestral groups have markedly different incidence rates and outcomes in many types of cancers. Therefore, the genetic admixture may cause biased genetic association study with cancer susceptibility variants specifically in Hispanics. For example, the incidence rate of liver cancer has been shown with substantial disparity between Hispanic, Asian and non-Hispanic white populations. Currently, ancestry informative marker (AIM) panels have been widely utilized with up to a few hundred ancestry-informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer ancestry admixture. Notably, current available AIMs are predominantly located in intron and intergenic regions, while the whole exome sequencing (WES) protocols commonly used in translational research and clinical practice do not cover these markers. Thus, it remains challenging to accurately determine a patient's admixture proportion without additional DNA testing. Results: In this study we designed an unique AIM panel that infers 3-way genetic admixture from three distinct and selective continental populations (African (AFR), European (EUR), and East Asian (EAS)) within evolutionarily conserved exonic regions. Initially, about 1 million exonic SNPs from selective three populations in the 1000 Genomes Project were trimmed by their linkage disequilibrium (LD), restricted to biallelic variants, and finally we optimized to an AIM panel with 250 SNP markers, or the UT-AIM250 panel, using their ancestral informativeness statistics. Comparing to published AIM panels, UT-AIM250 performed better accuracy when we tested with three ancestral populations (accuracy: 0.995 ± 0.012 for AFR, 0.997 ± 0.007 for EUR, and 0.994 ± 0.012 for EAS). We further demonstrated the performance of the UT-AIM250 panel to admixed American (AMR) samples of the 1000 Genomes Project and obtained similar results (AFR, 0.085 ± 0.098; EUR, 0.665 ± 0.182; and EAS, 0.250 ± 0.205) to previously published AIM panels (Phillips-AIM34: AFR, 0.096 ± 0.127, EUR, 0.575 ± 0.290, and EAS, 0.330 ± 0.315; Wei-AIM278: AFR, 0.070 ± 0.096, EUR, 0.537 ± 0.267, and EAS, 0.393 ± 0.300). Subsequently, we applied the UT-AIM250 panel to a clinical dataset of 26 self-reported Hispanic patients in South Texas with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We estimated the admixture proportions using WES data of adjacent non-cancer liver tissues (AFR, 0.065 ± 0.043; EUR, 0.594 ± 0.150; and EAS, 0.341 ± 0.160). Similar admixture proportions were identified from corresponding tumor tissues. In addition, we estimated admixture proportions of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) collection of hepatocellular carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) samples (376 patients) using the UT-AIM250 panel. The panel obtained consistent admixture proportions from tumor and matched normal tissues, identified 3 possible incorrectly reported race/ethnicity, and/or provided race/ethnicity determination if necessary. Conclusions: Here we demonstrated the feasibility of using evolutionarily conserved exonic regions to infer admixture proportions and provided a robust and reliable control for sample collection or patient stratification for genetic analysis. R implementation of UT-AIM250 is available at https://github.com/chenlabgccri/UT-AIM250.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The treatment outcome of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. The current study aimed to address the treatment efficacy and safety of DAAs in patients with curative or active HCC, compared with those of patients without HCC. Design: A prospective cohort study SETTING: A medical centre and two regional hospitals in Taiwan PARTICIPANTS: A total of 713 Taiwanese patients (601 non-HCC, 74 curative HCC and 38 active HCC patients) who received standard-of-care DAAs were consecutively enrolled in the study. Main outcome measurement: The primary objective was to determine treatment efficacy, defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA throughout 12 weeks of the post-treatment follow-up period (sustained virological response 12 [SVR12]). Results: The overall SVR12 rate was 96.9%. The SVR12 rate was similar between the patients with HCC and those without HCC (95.5% vs 97.2%, p=0.37). The HCC patients were divided into two groups, those with curative HCC and those with viable HCC; a substantially but not significantly lower SVR rate, 92.1% (35/38), was observed in the patients with viable HCC compared with the SVR rate, 97.3% (72/74), in those with curative HCC (p=0.33). Compared with the patients with curative HCC, the patients with viable HCC had a significantly higher proportion of serious adverse events (10.5% vs 1.0%, p=0.002), early treatment discontinuation (10.5% vs 2.8%, p=0.03) and mortality (5.3% vs 0.1%, p=0.008). Conclusions: An equivalently high SVR rate was observed in patients with either past or active HCC compared with those without HCC. The safety concerns in the HCC patients did not compromise treatment efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "In 69 statin-treated male coronary patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at goal levels (<70 mg/dl), the investigators tested whether low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (<40 mg/dl) and high triglyceride (>150 mg/dl) are associated with dysfunctional HDL particles and abnormal insulin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein serum levels. Thirty-four patients with low HDL cholesterol and high triglyceride (dyslipidemia) and 35 patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride at target levels (normolipidemia) were studied. Twenty healthy men were also studied. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured using immunonephelometry, insulin using a radioimmunometric assay, and total adiponectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell cholesterol efflux to serum and total isolated HDL was assayed using rat hepatoma Fu5AH cells for scavenger receptor class B type 1-mediated efflux. Compared to the normolipidemia and healthy groups, and after adjustment for age and waist circumference, patients with dyslipidemia showed higher fasting insulin (14, 9.9, and 8.5 μU/ml, respectively), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values (3.4, 2.3, and 1.8, respectively), lower adiponectin concentrations (5.1, 8.1, and 11 μg/ml, respectively), and reduced cholesterol efflux to serum (14%, 15%, and 19%, respectively) and to HDL fractions (4.4%, 4.6%, and 5.6%, respectively) (p <0.05 for all variables). Multivariate analysis showed that adiponectin and apolipoprotein A1 accounted for 10.7% and 3.9%, respectively, of the variance in cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, the decreased cholesterol efflux and metabolic abnormalities found in the dyslipidemia group may contribute to the residual risk observed in the large statin trials and the higher morbidity and mortality in statin-treated coronary patients with low HDL cholesterol even when attaining low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <70 mg/dl.",

    "Abstract": "This is the second of a two-part consideration of metastatic tumors to the ovary. Here, the matter is considered in 16 categories, largely site-specific. The first tumor discussed is gastric carcinoma of intestinal-type whose ovarian manifestations have been the subject of a recent paper which emphasized its differences from the Krukenberg tumor. Coverage of intestinal adenocarcinoma emphasizes the landmark 1987 paper of RH Lash and WR Hart. The section on pancreatic neoplasms reemphasizes the problems caused by metastatic ductal carcinoma, considered primarily in Part I, and discusses less common issues such as spread of neuroendocrine and acinar cell carcinomas. The limited information on spread of tumors of the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts is then reviewed before more detailed consideration of hepatic neoplasms, prompted by recent contributions on hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the latter based on significant experience with this problem in Thailand. The section on appendiceal neoplasms highlights ovarian spread of diverse tumors ranging from typical intestinal-type adenocarcinoma to signet-ring cell carcinomas with various patterns which in the ovary may prompt diagnoses such as a goblet cell (mucinous) carcinoid tumor, but whose ovarian features place them in the category of a Krukenberg tumor. The diverse problems in differential diagnosis of carcinoid tumor (provoked by nested, acinar, and other patterns, including folliclelike spaces) are then reviewed. The section on breast cancer emphasizes that, although usually a manifestation of late stage disease and often not bulky in the ovaries, metastatic breast cancer may form large masses which can represent the clinical presentation. That patients with breast cancer have an increased risk of primary ovarian cancer and that the latter is more common than secondary spread of breast cancer is noted. The section on lung tumors largely reflects information in a recent paper that small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are the lung cancers that spread to the ovary most commonly. The extremely broad differential diagnosis posed by metastatic malignant melanoma ranging from that of an oxyphilic tumor, to a small cell tumor, to a follicle-forming neoplasm, is then considered. The sections on renal cell carcinoma and other urinary tract neoplasms emphasize the differential diagnosis of metastatic clear cell carcinoma and primary clear cell carcinoma, an issue usually resolvable by an awareness of the various features of the ovarian variant, rarely or never seen in the renal variant. The section on metastatic sarcomas discusses endometrial stromal sarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal neoplasms, and miscellaneous other sarcomas. The endometrial stromal tumors are problematic largely because the history of a primary tumor may be remote, in the ovaries the typical growth and vascular pattern of endometrial stromal neoplasms is not always conspicuous, and some endometrial stromal sarcomas in the ovary show sex cordlike patterns of growth. Recent information has indicated that gastrointestinal stromal tumors may rarely have significant ovarian manifestations and if the primary neoplasm is overlooked, the ovarian tumor may be misdiagnosed, usually as an ovarian fibromatous tumor, but potentially as another primary neoplasm. The sections on ovarian spread of uterine carcinomas emphasize the problems owing to cervical adenocarcinomas, which have a greater tendency to involve the ovaries than squamous cell carcinomas and can simulate primary mucinous or endometrioid cancers. The final neoplasms considered are malignant mesothelioma and the desmoplastic small round cell tumor. The microscopic features of malignant mesothelioma are so different from those of primary ovarian carcinoma in most instances that the diagnosis should be readily established on routine microscopic evaluation. The differential diagnosis of the desmoplastic small round cell tumor is more complex because of the greater overlap with the many other small cell malignant tumors that may involve the ovaries primarily or secondarily. Nonetheless, differences exist in most cases and awareness of the entity should lead to consideration of the desmoplastic neoplasm, particularly in a young female. In this area, as in a number of others considered in the review, immunohistochemistry may play a significant, sometimes crucial, role. However, as pointed out in brief concluding remarks, despite the aid of that modality, as in surgical pathology overall, careful consideration of the clinical background, distribution of disease, gross characteristics and spectrum of routine microscopic findings, will lead to the correct diagnosis in the majority of cases and at the very least lead to formulation of a considered differential diagnosis such that use of special techniques may be judicious and those results placed in context of the time-honored clinical and pathologic features.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Racial disparities in the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exist. Gene mutations have a profound effect on carcinogenesis, are easily affected by environment and etiology factors, and may result in survival divergences among patients with different racial backgrounds. This report explores the effects of gene mutations on the survival of American Caucasians and Asian patients. Methods: The sequencing and clinical data of 336 HCC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The sequencing data was subject to gene mutation profiling, and an analysis of immune cell infiltration was conducted. A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the independent effects of gene mutations on patients' overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Asian HCC patients had a significantly higher level of TP53 mutation frequency than Caucasian HCC patients (Asian vs. Caucasian, 39% vs. 23%; P=0.003). The TP53 mutation was associated with shorter OS [hazard ratio (HR), 2.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-3.97; P=0.002] and DFS (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.38-3.51; P<0.001) in Caucasian HCC patients, but had no effect on Asian HCC patients' survival. Compared to Asian HCC patients, Caucasian HCC patients with the TP53 mutation had a decreased proportion of infiltrating M2 macrophages and activating natural killer (NK) cells, and an increased proportion of follicular helper T cells. The RB1 mutation was associated with shorter OS (HR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.73-6.57; P<0.001) in Asian HCC patients, and shorter DFS (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.15-3.88; P=0.017) in Caucasian HCC patients. Asian HCC patients with the RB1 mutation had a decreased proportion of infiltrating CD8 T cells. Conclusions: The effects of the TP53 and RB1 mutations on survival differ among Asian and Caucasian HCC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Aberrant splicing is a common outcome in the presence of exonic or intronic variants that might hamper the intricate network of interactions defining an exon in a specific gene context. Therefore, the evaluation of the functional, and potentially pathological, role of nucleotide changes remains one of the major challenges in the modern genomic era. This aspect has also to be taken into account during the pre-clinical evaluation of innovative therapeutic approaches in animal models of human diseases. This is of particular relevance when developing therapeutics acting on splicing, an intriguing and expanding research area for several disorders. Here, we addressed species-specific splicing mechanisms triggered by the OTC c.386G>A mutation, relatively frequent in humans, leading to Ornithine TransCarbamylase Deficiency (OTCD) in patients and spfash mice, and its differential susceptibility to RNA therapeutics based on engineered U1snRNA. Methods: Creation and co-expression of engineered U1snRNAs with human and mouse minigenes, either wild-type or harbouring different nucleotide changes, in human (HepG2) and mouse (Hepa1-6) hepatoma cells followed by analysis of splicing pattern. RNA pulldown studies to evaluate binding of specific splicing factors. Results: Comparative nucleotide analysis suggested a role for the intronic +10-11 nucleotides, and pull-down assays showed that they confer preferential binding to the TIA1 splicing factor in the mouse context, where TIA1 overexpression further increases correct splicing. Consistently, the splicing profile of the human minigene with mouse +10-11 nucleotides overlapped that of mouse minigene, and restored responsiveness to TIA1 overexpression and to compensatory U1snRNA. Swapping the human +10-11 nucleotides into the mouse context had opposite effects. Moreover, the interplay between the authentic and the adjacent cryptic 5'ss in the human OTC dictates pathogenic mechanisms of several OTCD-causing 5'ss mutations, and only the c.386+5G>A change, abrogating the cryptic 5'ss, was rescuable by engineered U1snRNA. Conclusions: Subtle intronic variations explain species-specific OTC splicing patterns driven by the c.386G>A mutation, and the responsiveness to engineered U1snRNAs, which suggests careful elucidation of molecular mechanisms before proposing translation of tailored therapeutics from animal models to humans.",

    "Abstract": "Context: Hepatic adenoma is an uncommon, benign, hepatic neoplasm that typically occurs in women of child-bearing age, often with a history of long-term use of oral contraceptive drugs. This is usually detected as an incidental mass lesion in a noncirrhotic liver during imaging studies. Pathologic evaluation by needle core biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Molecular studies have revealed that hepatic adenomas involve unique molecular pathways that are distinct from hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on these studies, a French collaborative group has recently proposed a molecular-pathologic classification for hepatic adenomas. In addition, advances in molecular studies have led to reclassification of the \"telangiectatic variant of focal nodular hyperplasia\" as \"hepatic adenoma, inflammatory subtype.\" Objective: To review the proposed, new classification of hepatic adenoma and the changes in diagnostic workup in light of the above-mentioned developments. Data sources: Review of published literature and illustrations from clinical case material. Conclusions: Definitive diagnosis of liver mass lesion on needle core biopsies has a decisive role in clinical management. With the advent of the new classification of hepatic adenomas and its prognostic implications, it is vital for pathologists to be aware of the morphologic features seen in different subtypes and the available diagnostic tools, such as immunohistochemistry, to help identify the correct subtype.",

    "Abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) had been proved to be pivotal regulators in carcinogenesis. On the basis of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) system, lncRNAs significantly expanded their regulating networks. In our research, we aimed to figure out the exact role of lncRNA HNF1A-AS1 in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in a ceRNA-dependent way. First, we revealed: HNF1A-AS1 was frequently overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines and its relative high expression was closely related to larger tumor size, multiple tumor lesions, poor differentiation and advanced TNM stage. Then we found: HNF1A-AS1 functioned as an oncogene in tumor growth and apoptosis through sponging tumor-suppressive hsa-miR-30b-5p (miR-30b) and de-repressing Bcl-2. Further experiments identified: HNF1A-AS1-miR-30b axis significantly promoted autophagy under starvation and ATG5 was first proved to be a target of miR-30b. In summary, we identified HNF1A-AS1-miR-30b axis as a key regulator in hepatocarcinogenesis, which may be promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the future.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) is an atypical homeodomain-containing transcription factor that transactivates liver-specific genes including albumin, α-1-antitrypsin and α- and β-fibrinogen. Biallelic inactivating mutations of HNF1A have been frequently identified in hepatocellular adenomas (HCA), rare benign liver tumors usually developed in women under oral contraceptives, and in rare cases of hepatocellular carcinomas developed in non-cirrhotic liver. HNF1α-mutated HCA (H-HCA) are characterized by a marked steatosis and show activation of glycolysis, lipogenesis, translational machinery and mTOR pathway. We studied the consequences of HNF1α silencing in hepatic cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B and we reproduced most of the deregulations identified in H-HCA. Methods: We transfected hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B with siRNA targeting HNF1α and obtained a strong inhibition of HNF1α expression. We then looked at the phenotypic changes by microscopy and studied changes in gene expression using qRT-PCR and Western Blot. Results: Hepatocytes transfected with HNF1α siRNA underwent severe phenotypic changes with loss of cell-cell contacts and development of migration structures. In HNF1α-inhibited cells, hepatocyte and epithelial markers were diminished and mesenchymal markers were over-expressed. This epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was related to the up regulation of several EMT transcription factors, in particular SNAIL and SLUG. We also found an overexpression of TGFβ1, an EMT initiator, in both cells transfected with HNF1α siRNA and H-HCA. Moreover, TGFβ1 expression is strongly correlated to HNF1α expression in cell models, suggesting regulation of TGFβ1 expression by HNF1α. Conclusion: Our results suggest that HNF1α is not only important for hepatocyte differentiation, but has also a role in the maintenance of epithelial phenotype in hepatocytes.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta (HNF1 β/B) exists as a homeobox transcription factor having a vital role in the embryonic development of organs mainly liver, kidney and pancreas. Initially described as a gene causing maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), HNF1β expression deregulation and single nucleotide polymorphisms in HNF1β have now been associated with several tumours including endometrial, prostate, ovarian, hepatocellular, renal and colorectal cancers. Its function has been studied either as homodimer or heterodimer with HNF1α. In this review, the role of HNF1B in different cancers will be discussed along with the role of its splice variants, and its emerging role as a potential biomarker in cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a devastating multi-system disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, immunodeficiency, genetic instability, premature aging and growth retardation. Due to better care the patients get older than in the past and new disease entities like disturbed glucose tolerance and liver disease emerge. The objective of the present investigation is to determine the evolution of liver disease and its relation to age and neurological deterioration. The study included 67 patients aged 1 to 38 years with classical A-T. At least two measurements of liver enzymes were performed within a minimum interval of 6 months in 56 patients. The median follow-up period was 4 years (1-16 years). A total of 316 liver enzyme measurements were performed. For analysis, patients were divided into two age groups (Group 1: <12 years; group 2: ≥12 years). In addition, ultrasound of the liver and Klockgether Ataxia Score (KAS) were analyzed. We found significantly higher levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (226,8 ± 20.87 ng/ml vs. 565,1 ± 24.3 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), and liver enzymes like ALT (23.52 ± 0.77 IU/L vs. 87.83 ± 5.31 IU/L, p < 0.0001) in patients in group 2. In addition, we could show a significant correlation between age and AFP, GGT, and KAS. Ultrasound revealed hepatic steatosis in 11/19 (57.9%) patients in group 2. One female patient aged 37 years died due to a hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver disease is present in the majority of older A-T patients. Structural changes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and fibrosis are frequent findings. Progress of liver disease is concomitant to neurological deterioration.",

    "Abstract": "A precise and noninvasive method to predict posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in clinical practice is still lacking. Liver fibrosis or cirrhosis accompanied with varying degrees of portal hypertension plays an important role in the occurrence of PHLF in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This study aims to compare the predictive ability of the albumin-bilirubin score to spleen thickness ratio (ALBI/ST) versus fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet count ratio index (ARPI) for the occurrence of PHLF. We retrospectively enrolled 932 patients who underwent liver resection for HCC between 2010 and 2017. The predictive accuracy of ALBI/ST ratio, FIB-4, and APRI for occurrence of PHLF was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. PHLF was diagnosed in 69 (7.4%) patients. The ALBI/ST ratio was found to be a significant predictor of PHLF. The AUC of ALBI/ST (AUC = 0.774; 95% CI, 0.731-0.817; P <.001) was larger than that of FIB-4 (AUC = 0.696; 95% CI, 0.634-0.759; P <.001) and APRI (AUC = 0.697; 95% CI, 0.629-0.764; P <.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ALBI/ST ratio was a strong risk factor of PHLF in all hepatectomy subgroups. In conclusion, the ALBI/ST ratio has a superior predictive ability for PHLF compared with APRI and FIB-4.",

    "Abstract": "Dysregulation of miRNAs is a common feature in human cancers, and miR-140-5p has been found to be down-regulated in cancer. However its role in ovarian cancer remains unclear. miR-140-5p was underexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines compared with their normal controls. Additionally, PDGFRA was predicted the target gene of miR-140-5p. PDGFRA was inversely correlated with the expression of miR-140-5p in ovarian cancer cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the over expression of miR-140-5p significantly inhibits ovarian cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. Our results suggest the existence of a novel miR-140-5p-PDGFRA pathway and indicate that miR-140-5p acts as a tumor suppressor during ovarian carcinogenesis. These results may provide a promising alterative strategy for the therapeutic treatment of ovarian cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common liver malignancy worldwide and genetic factors play important roles in the pathogenesis of HCC. Based on in-silico analysis, a case-control study including 420 HCC patients and 420 healthy controls was conducted to investigate the association between HCC susceptibility with a 4-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs17875871) in the 3'UTR of IFNAR1. Computational modeling suggested that rs17875871 was located in seed region of miR-1231 potential target sequence in IFNAR1 3'UTR. Logistic regression analysis showed that the heterozygote and the 4-bp del/del homozygote genotypes confer significantly higher risks of HCC (adjusted OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.01-1.83, P=0.045; OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.18-2.84, P=0.006, respectively). Stratification analysis revealed that this association was more pronounced in HBsAg positive subgroup. Our findings suggested common genetic changes in IFNAR1 may influence HCC risk, likely through miR-1231-mediated regulation, which is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of HBV related HCC. Further replication studies and functional characterization of rs17875871 were needed to fully clarify the underlined molecular mechanism.",

    "Abstract": "STAT3 is an oncogene which mainly capable of regulating various biological characters by its transcriptional factor features driving thousands of genes. However, its upstream noncoding RNA-related regulations still remain unknown. In this study, we focused on the microRNA (miRNA)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3' unstranslated region (UTR) of STAT3 to investigate the further relationship of the SNPs with miRNAs among Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that patients suffering from HBV infection indicated to be the susceptible population by comparing with controls. Besides, SNP rs111904020 (U/G) in STAT3, 3'UTR was involved in the occurrence of HCC by acting as tumor promoter factors. SNP rs111904020 (U/G) could be regulated by miR-214 which caused an upregulation of STAT3. Furthermore, the carriers of G genotype was related to high expression of STAT3, and larger tumor size as well as high probability of metastasis. Moreover, the SNP of U/G was associated with poor survival and high reoccurrence of HCC with a 5-year follow-up study. In conclusion, our findings have shown that the SNP rs111904020 (U/G) in STAT3 3'UTR acted as promotion factors in the HCC development through disrupting the regulatory role of miR-214 in STAT3 expression.",

Fine- needle aspiration of the mass revealed malignant cells compatible with hepatocellular carcinoma. Interestingly, the patient had a left adrenalectomy and complete left nephrectomy in 1987, for a non-functioning left adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). The ACC was diagnosed as stage two, with no evidence of local invasion or distant metastases. No adjuvant therapy was recommended postoperatively.

    "Abstract": "Background: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended for patients with intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to treatment guidelines. However, a large number of patients with advanced HCC also receive TACE in clinical practice, especially for those with liver-confined HCC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (ECOG) 1. In view of previous studies, such patients have different prognoses from advanced HCC patients with macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread; therefore, patients with ECOG 1 alone might be classified into the intermediate stage and benefit from TACE treatment, but a study particularly focusing on such patients and exploring the effectiveness of TACE therapy is lacking. Aim: To investigate treatment outcomes of TACE in HCC patients with ECOG 1 alone and propose a specific prognostic model. Methods: Patients from 24 Chinese tertiary hospitals were selected in this nationwide multicenter observational study from January 2010 to May 2016. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression was used to develop the potential prognostic models. The discriminatory ability of the models was compared and validated in various patient subgroups. The individual survival prediction for six-and-twelve (6&12) criteria, defined as the algebraic sum of tumor size (cm) and tumor number, was illustrated by contour plot of 3-year survival probability and nomogram. Results: A total of 792 eligible patients were included. During follow-up, median OS reached 18.9 mo [95% confidence interval (CI): 16.9-21.0]. Three independent multivariate analyses demonstrated that tumor size, tumor number, α-fetoprotein level, albumin-bilirubin grade and total bilirubin were prognostic factors of OS (P < 0.05). The previously proposed 6&12 criteria was comparable or even better than currently proposed with the highest predictive ability. In addition, the 6&12 criteria was correlated with OS in various subgroups of patients. The patients were stratified into three strata with score ≤ 6, > 6 but ≤ 12, and > 12 with different median OS of 39.8 mo (95%CI: 23.9-55.7), 21.1 mo (95%CI: 18.4-23.8) and 9.8 mo (95%CI: 8.3-11.3), respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusion: TACE is effective for advanced HCC patients with ECOG 1 alone, and the 6&12 criteria may help with clinical decision-making.",

    "Abstract": "Egypt has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the world. HCV contributes to the development of about 70% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases. Understanding the molecular basis of hepatocarcinogenesis is important for planning the therapeutic regimen for HCC patients. To clarify the possible role of mismatch repair (MMR) genes in HCV-related HCC, we studied 50 HCV-related HCC specimens (28 of which were with adjacent non-cancerous cirrhotic liver tissue, ANCLT) and 30 specimens of chronic liver disease (CLD) with no evidence of HCC. All cases were examined immunohistochemically to demonstrate the protein expression of hMSH2 and hMLH1. Thirty-two (64%) and 35 (70%) of the HCC cases revealed reduced expression of hMSH2 and hMLH1, respectively. Reduced expression of both the proteins was obtained in 26 (52%) of the HCC cases. The expression of hMSH2 and hMLH1 was reduced in 53.6% and 64.3% of ANCLT cases, respectively, with no significant difference between HCC and ANCLT. All 30 specimens of CLD had preserved expression of hMSH2 and hMLH1. Multivariate analysis showed that the reduced expression of hMSH2 or hMLH1 was significantly associated with higher grades of the tumor (p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively).The relationships of these MMR genes with other clinicopathologic factors were not significant. Reduced expression of hMSH2 and hMLH1 in both HCC and ANCLT suggests that this event occurs at early stages of HCV-related hepatocarcinogenesis. Moreover, the significant association between reduced expression of both MMR genes and poor histologic grades of the tumor claims that these proteins are involved in the process of cancer progression.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) that are very large in size are a very rare finding in young adult. The malignant transformation of a pigmented hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) with beta-Catenin activation is a possible cause for appearance of HCC. Presentation of case: We present the case of a 33-year-old male with a huge HCC with bone metastasis, emerged from pigmented HCA with beta-Catenin activation. As a two-stage surgical procedure, a left hepatectomy followed by a partial rib resection was performed. Discussion: Giant hepatocellular carcinomas mostly develop in non-cirrhotic livers and at time of diagnosis an extrahepatic spread occurs in up to 15%. In the present case, the progression from a benign HCA to malignant HCC was documented, as a unique finding. Surgical resection is the only curative treatment and was successfully performed in this case. Conclusion: Hepatobiliary surgery with resection of metastases is the treatment with best long-term survival for patients with huge HCC. Molecular characterization as well as pigmentation analysis is useful tools for risk assessment of HCA.",

    "Abstract": "Summary: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive cancer that originates in the cortex of the adrenal gland and generally has a poor prognosis. ACC is rare but can be more commonly seen in those with cancer predisposition syndromes (e.g. Li-Fraumeni and Lynch Syndrome). The diagnosis of ACC is sometimes uncertain and it requires the use of precise molecular pathology; the differential diagnosis includes pheochromocytoma, adrenal adenoma, renal carcinoma, or hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe a case of a 57-year-old woman with Lynch Syndrome and metastatic ACC who was initially diagnosed as having pheochromocytoma. The tumor was first identified at 51 years of age by ultrasound followed by a CT scan. She underwent a left adrenalectomy, and the histopathology identified pheochromocytoma. Two years later, she had tumor recurrence with imaging studies showing multiple lung nodules. Following a wedge resection by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), histopathology was read as metastatic pheochromocytoma at one institution and metastatic ACC at another institution. She later presented to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where the diagnosis of ACC was confirmed. Following her ACC diagnosis, she was treated with mitotane and pembrolizumab which were stopped due to side effects and progression of disease. She is currently receiving etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (EDP). This case highlights the importance of using a multi-disciplinary approach in patient care. Thorough evaluation of the tumor's pathology and analysis of the patient's genetic profile are necessary to obtain the correct diagnosis for the patient and can significantly influence the course of treatment. Learning points: Making the diagnosis of ACC can be difficult as the differential diagnosis includes pheochromocytoma, adrenal adenoma, renal carcinoma, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with Lynch Syndrome should undergo surveillance for ACC as there is evidence of an association between Lynch Syndrome and ACC. Conducting a complete tumor immunoprofile and obtaining a second opinion is very important in cases of suspected ACC in order to confirm the proper diagnosis. A multi-disciplinary approach including genetic testing and a thorough evaluation of the tumor's pathology is imperative to ensuring that the patient receives an accurate diagnosis and the appropriate treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hospital re-admissions in decompensated cirrhosis are associated with worse patient outcomes. Hispanics have a disproportionately high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting re-admission rates among Hispanics with HCV-related cirrhosis. Methods: A total of 292 consecutive HCV-related cirrhosis admissions (Hispanics 189, non-Hispanics 103) from January 2009 to December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed; 132 were cirrhosis-related re-admissions. The statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 11.1. Chi-square/Fisher's exact and Student's t-tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for hospital readmissions. Results: Among the 132 cirrhosis-related readmissions, 71% were Hispanics while 29% were non-Hispanics (P=0.035). Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and esophageal variceal hemorrhage were the most frequent causes of the first and subsequent readmissions. Hispanics with readmissions had a higher Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class (B and C) and higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores (≥15), as well as a higher incidence of alcohol use, HE, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and varices (P<0.05). The majority of the study patients (81%) had MELD scores <15. Multivariate regression analysis identified alcohol use (OR 2.63; 95%CI 1.1-6.4), HE (OR 5.5; 95%CI 2-15.3), varices (OR 3.2; 95%CI 1.3-8.2), and CTP class (OR 3.3; 95%CI 1.4-8.1) as predictors for readmissions among Hispanics. Conclusion: CTP classes B and C, among other factors, were the major predictors for hospital readmissions in Hispanics with HCV-related cirrhosis. The majority of these readmissions were due to HE and variceal hemorrhage.",

    "Abstract": "The APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene is responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis and is also associated with the development of sporadic tumors of the colon and stomach. To investigate whether or not mutations of APC play any role in tumors arising in other organs, we examined somatic mutations of this gene in sporadic (nonfamilial) renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cancers of the lung and pancreas. DNAs isolated from tumors were examined by means of a RNase protection analysis, coupled with the polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. By screening a part of the APC coding region, we detected somatic mutations in four of ten pancreatic cancers; each of these mutations would yield a truncated APC product due to a 1- or 5-base pair deletion. These results imply that mutations in APC contribute to carcinogenesis in the pancreas.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver diseases with simple steatosis on one end and hepatocellular carcinoma on the other. Although obesity is a known risk factor for NAFLD, individuals with normal body mass index (BMI) also have hepatic fatty infiltration, now termed \"lean-NAFLD\". It represents a distinct entity with a strong underlying genetic component. The present study aimed to sequence the complete exonic regions of individuals with lean-NAFLD to identify germline causative variants associated with disrupted hepatic fatty acid metabolism, thereby conferring susceptibility to NAFLD. Methods: Whole blood was collected from patients with lean-NAFLD (n = 6; BMI < 23.0 kg/m2) and matched lean controls (n = 2; discovery set). Liver fat was assessed using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. Patients with ultrasound-detected NAFLD (n = 191) and controls (n = 105) were part of validation set. DNA was isolated, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the discovery cohort (Ion Proton™; Ion AmpliSeq™ Exome RDY Kit). Data were analyzed (Ion Reporter software; Life Technologies), and variants identified. Validation of variants was carried out (Taqman probes; Real time-PCR). Student's t test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the statistical significance. Results: Although WES identified ∼74,000 variants in individual samples, using various pipelines. variants in genes namely phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein10 (OSBPL10) that have roles in dietary choline intake and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, respectively, were identified (discovery set). Furthermore, significant differences were noted in BMI (p = 0.006), waist/hip circumference (p > 0.001), waist/hip ratio (p > 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (p > 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (p > 0.001), and triglycerides (p = 0.002) between patients and controls. Validation of variants (rs7946-PEMT and rs2290532-OSBPL10) revealed that variant in PEMT but not OSBPL10 gene was associated (p = 0.04) with threefold increased risk of NAFLD in lean individuals. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the association of rs7946 with lean-NAFLD. WES may be an effective strategy to identify causative variants underlying lean-NAFLD.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The majority of clinical trials of first-line systemic treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) used placebo or sorafenib as comparators, and there are limited data providing a cross comparison of treatments in this setting, especially for newly-approved immune checkpoint inhibitor and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor combination treatments. Aim: To systematically review and compare response rates, survival outcomes, and safety of first-line systemic therapies for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: We searched PubMed, Science Direct, the Cochrane Database, Excerpta Medica Database, and abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 annual congress. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of systemic therapy enrolling adults with advanced/unresectable HCC. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials. A network meta-analysis was used to synthesize data and perform direct and indirect comparisons between treatments. P value, a frequentist analog to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve, was used to rank treatments. Results: In total, 1398 articles were screened and 27 included. Treatments compared were atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, brivanib, donafenib, dovitinib, FOLFOX4, lenvatinib, linifanib, nintedanib, nivolumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, vandetanib, 11 sorafenib combination therapies, and three other combination therapies. For overall response rate, lenvatinib ranked 1/19, followed by atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and nivolumab. For progression-free survival (PFS), atezolizumab + bevacizumab was ranked 1/15, followed by lenvatinib. With the exception of atezolizumab + bevacizumab [hazard ratios (HR)PFS = 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-1.25], the estimated HRs for PFS for all included treatments vs lenvatinib were > 1; however, the associated 95%CI passed through unity for bevacizumab plus erlotinib, linifanib, and FOLFOX4. For overall survival, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was ranked 1/25, followed by vandetanib 100 mg/d and donafinib, with lenvatinib ranked 6/25. Atezolizumab + bevacizumab was associated with a lower risk of death vs lenvatinib (HRos = 0.63; 95%CI: 0.44-0.89), while the HR for overall survival for most other treatments vs lenvatinib had associated 95%CIs that passed through unity. Vandetanib 300 mg/d and 100 mg/d were ranked 1/13 and 2/13, respectively, for the lowest incidence of treatment terminations due to adverse events, followed by sorafenib (5/13), lenvatinib (10/13), and atezolizumab + bevacizumab (13/13). Conclusion: There is not one single first-line treatment for advanced HCC associated with superior outcomes across all outcome measurements. Therefore, first-line systemic treatment should be selected based on individualized treatment goals.",

In the present study we describe a novel mutant gammac chain of an X-SCID patient with a typical X-SCID phenotype. This mutant receptor subunit is able to associate with Jak3 to transduce a weak signal. The Jak3-specific action is demonstrated by the induction of gene expression through the haematopoietin receptor response element (HRRE) by IL-2 and IL-4 in the experimental model of transiently transfected hepatoma cells over-expressing Jak3. This result suggests that a threshold in the gammac-Jak3 interaction determines the X-SCID phenotype.",

    "Abstract": "Nucleophosmin is a nucleolar phosphoprotein that shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm. Recent reports demonstrated that exon 12 of the nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) gene was frequently mutated in acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs). To see whether the NPM1 mutation occurs in other malignancies, we analyzed exon 12 of NPM1 for the detection of somatic mutations in 467 carcinomas, including 142 lung, 47 hepatocellular, 93 breast, 103 colorectal and 82 gastric carcinomas, by single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. We also analyzed the NPM1 mutation in 142 acute leukemias, including 105 AMLs. We detected 15 NPM1 mutations in the AMLs (14.3%), but there was no NPM1 mutation in the other malignancies analyzed. Our data indicate that NPM1 exon 12 is mutated in AMLs, but not in other common human cancers, and suggest that the NPM1 mutation may not play a role in the tumorigenesis of common solid cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Radiological progression patterns to first-line sorafenib have been associated with post-progression and overall survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but these associations remain unknown for therapies in second- and later-line settings. This post hoc analysis of REACH and REACH-2 examined outcomes by radiological progression patterns in the second-line setting of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with ramucirumab or placebo. Methods: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, Child-Pugh A and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 or 1 with prior sorafenib were randomized to receive ramucirumab 8mg/kg or placebo every 2 weeks. Among 625 patients with ≥1 progression pattern (new extrahepatic lesion [including new macrovascular invasion], new intrahepatic lesion, extrahepatic growth or intrahepatic growth), data were analysed by trial and for pooled individual patient data for REACH-2 and REACH (alpha-fetoprotein ≥400 ng/mL). Cox models evaluated prognostic implications of progression patterns on overall and post-progression survival. Results: Post-progression survival was worse among those with new extrahepatic lesions in REACH (HR 2.33, 95% CI 1.51-3.60), REACH-2 (HR 1.49, 95% CI 0.72-3.08) and the pooled population (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.74) compared to other progression patterns. Overall survival was also significantly reduced in those with new extrahepatic lesions across studies. Ramucirumab provided an overall survival benefit across progression patterns, including patients with new extrahepatic lesions (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.80) in the pooled population. Conclusions: The emergence of new extrahepatic lesions in the second-line setting is a poor prognostic factor for post-progression survival. The benefit of ramucirumab for overall survival was consistent across progression patterns.",

    "Abstract": "Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) simultaneously target many transcripts through partial complementarity binding, and have emerged as a key type of post-transcriptional regulator for gene expression. How miRNA accomplishes its pleiotropic effects largely depends on its expression and its target repertoire. Previous studies discovered thousands of miRNAs and numerous miRNA target genes mainly through computation and prediction methods which produced high rates of false positive prediction. The development of Argonaute cross-linked immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) provides a system to effectively determine miRNA target genes. Likewise, the accuracy of dissecting the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes has been greatly improved by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the transcription factors coupled with sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Elucidation of the miRNA target repertoire will provide an in-depth understanding of the functional roles of microRNA pathways. To reliably reconstruct a miRNA-mediated regulatory network, we established a computational framework using publicly available, sequence-based transcription factor-miRNA databases, including ChIPBase and TransmiR for the TF-miRNA interactions, along with miRNA-target databases, including miRTarBase, TarBase and starBase, for the miRNA-target interactions. We applied the computational framework to elucidate the miRNA-mediated regulatory network in the Mir122a⁻/⁻ mouse model, which has an altered transcriptome and progressive liver disease. Results: We applied our computational framework to the expression profiles of miRNA/mRNA of Mir122a⁻/⁻ mutant mice and wild-type mice. The miRNA-mediated network involves 40 curated TFs contributing to the aberrant expression of 65 miRNAs and 723 curated miRNA target genes, of which 56% was found in the differentially-expressed genes of Mir122a--mice. Hence, the regulatory network disclosed previously-known and also many previously-unidentified miRNA-mediated regulations in mutant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of imprinting at the chromosome 12qF1 region is associated with miRNA overexpression in human hepatocellular carcinoma and stem cells, suggesting initiation of precancerous changes in young mice deficient in miR-122. A group of 9 miRNAs was found to share miR-122 target genes, indicating synergy between miRNAs and target genes by way of multiplicity and cooperativity. Conclusions: The study provides significant insight into miRNA-mediated regulatory networks. Based on experimentally verified data, this network is highly reliable and effective in revealing previously-undetermined disease-associated molecular mechanisms. This computational framework can be applied to explore the significant TF-miRNA-miRNA target interactions in any complex biological systems with high degrees of confidence.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/aims: To understand the changing demands for hepatic resection (HR), we collected data regarding HR performed in a tertiary centre over a period of 10 years. Methods: We carried out extensive search of institutional databases to identify HR cases performed between January 2005 and December 2014. A study cohort of 9,016 patients were divided into 5 disease categories, namely hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), intrahepatic duct stone disease (IHDS), colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), and uncommon/rare diseases (URD). Results: There were 5,661 (62.8%) HCC cases, followed by 1441 (16.0%) CRLM, 942 (10.5%) ICC, 638 (7.1%) IHDS and 334 (3.7%) URD. The number of annual HR cases gradually increased from 443 in 2005 to 1,260 in 2015. Annual HCC cases also gradually increased, but the annual proportion of HCC cases fluctuated narrowly between 58.3% and 70.2%. Annual CRLM cases increased rapidly, and their proportion increased progressively from 4.7% to 20.5%. Annual ICC cases increased slowly, and their annual proportion fluctuated between 7.2% and 15.6%. Annual IHDS cases decreased slowly, and their annual proportion decreased progressively from 17.2% to 3.4%, while annual URD cases fluctuated, with annual proportions varying between 2.3% and 5.6%. Conclusions: Annual cases of HR increased over the last 10 years in a tertiary center probably due to a center-specific centralization effect. The number of CRLM cases increased rapidly; those of HCC and ICC increased gradually, and those of IHDS declined gradually. We believe that these results reflect real changes in the types of liver disease requiring HR.",

Methods: Literature was searched systematically from PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane search engines for full-length articles written in English that examined PNPLA3 polymorphism in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. Studies evaluating the association of PNPLA3 polymorphism spectrum (fatty liver, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma) of CHC were included. Pooled data are reported as OR with 95%CI. Our study endpoint was the risk of the entire liver disease spectrum including: Steatosis/fatty liver, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in CHC patients with PNPLA3 polymorphisms. Results: Of 380 studies identified, a total of 53 studies were included for full-text review. Nineteen on chronic hepatitis C were eligible for analysis. Pooled ORs for rs738409 GG compared to CC and CG among patients with fatty liver was 2.214 (95%CI: 1.719-2.853). ORs among advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis were 1.762 (95%CI: 1.258-2.468). Similar odds ratios among hepatocellular carcinoma patients were 2.002 (95%CI: 1.519-2.639). Pooled ORs for rs738409 GG and CG compared to CC among patients with fatty liver were 1.750 (95%CI: 1.542-1.986). Pooled ORs for advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis patients were 1.613 (95%CI: 1.211-2.147). All analyses were homogenous and without publication bias except one. The associations were maintained after adjusting for publication bias and heterogeneity.

The DCR was 81.3% in the C-TACE-A group and 72.9% in the D-TACE-A group. Cox regression analysis showed that D-TACE-A did not increase mortality risk or tumor recurrence risk. After PSM, there was no statistically significant difference in median OS or PFS between the two groups. In the subgroup analysis, after adjusting for relative factors, D-TACE-A increased the mortality risk more than C-TACE-A in patients with BCLC stage C (HR: 1.678, 95% CI: 1.129-2.495; P=0.011), but D-TACE-A lowered the tumor recurrence risk compared with C-TACE-A in patients with Child-Pugh B (HR: 0.210, 95% CI: 0.082-0.538; P=0.001) and cirrhosis (HR: 0.481, 95% CI: 0.293-0.791; P=0.004). Grade III and IV adverse events in patients with D-TACE-A were similar to those in patients treated with C-TACE-A (P>0.05). Conclusion: Patients with unresectable HCC treated with D-TACE-A might not show increased survival compared with patients treated with C-TACE-A. Advanced HCC patients without cirrhosis may receive greater survival benefits from C-TACE-A than D-TACE-A.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide with limited treatment options. Mutation of β-catenin is one of the most frequent genetic events along hepatocarcinogenesis. β-catenin mutations can be in the form of point mutation or large N-terminal deletion. Studies suggested that different β-catenin mutations might have distinct oncogenic potential. Methods: We tested the oncogenic activity of β-cateninS45Y, one of the most frequent point mutations of β-catenin, and ∆N90-β-catenin, a form of β-catenin with a large N-terminal deletion, in promoting HCC development in mice. Thus, we co-expressed β-cateninS45Y or ∆N90-β-catenin together with c-Met into the mouse liver using hydrodynamic injection. Results: We found that both β-catenin mutations were able to induce HCC formation in combination with c-Met at the same latency and efficiency. Tumors showed similar histological features and proliferation rates. However, immunohistochemistry showed predominantly nuclear staining of β-catenin in c-Met/∆N90-β-catenin HCC, but membrane immunoreactivity in c-Met/β-cateninS45Y HCC. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that both ∆N90-β-catenin and β-cateninS45Y induced the same effectors, although at somewhat different levels. In cultured cells, both ∆N90-β-catenin and β-cateninS45Y were capable of inducing TCF/LEF reporter expression, promoting proliferation, and inhibiting apoptosis. Conclusions: Our study suggests that β-cateninS45Y and ∆N90-β-catenin, in combination with the c-Met proto-oncogene, have similar oncogenic potential. Furthermore, nuclear staining of β-catenin does not always characterize β-catenin activity.",

    "Abstract": "Rationale: Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with specific cutaneous manifestations, which is closely associated with malignancy. However, the exact mechanism remains elusive. Even less is known about dermatomyositis with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patient concerns: We reported a case of dermatomyositis with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. He incidentally found his lower limbs little weakness accompanied with his wrist erythema. He was found HBsAg positive for forty years with slightly positive of α-fetal protein (AFP). Diagnoses: A dermapathology from his hand-wrist lesions demonstrated a scattered inflammatory infiltrate around the capillaries of the dermis. Abdominal enhanced computer tomography (CT) revealed infiltrative HCC affecting the whole liver, accompanied by liver metastasis and liver cirrhosis. Liver tumor needle biopsy pathology showed HCC with moderate differentiation. The left supraclavicular lymph node needle biopsy pathology confirmed metastasic HCC. Interventions: Prednisolone was gradually withdrawn with the introduction of Entecavir 0.5 mg daily. Radiofrequency ablation therapy for liver tumor was performed once in order to decrease the tumor load. Outcomes: His muscle power improved to grade 4+/5 in the lower limb one month after anti-HBV treatment. However, this patient died finally from liver failure due to the development of liver tumor. Lessons: In the coming clinic work, we must pay more attention to the extrahepatic disorder induced by HBV. On treating experience, glucocorticoid administration is often contraindicated for HBV infected patients because of its potential promotion of HBV replication. Thus, it is necessary to administrate high-effective anti-HBV drug prior to glucocorticoid treatment in order to prevent liver failure.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Leukodystrophies constitute heterogenous group of rare heritable disorders primarily affecting the white matter of central nervous system. These conditions are often under-appreciated among physicians. The first clinical manifestations of leukodystrophies are often nonspecific and can occur in different ages from neonatal to late adulthood periods. The diagnosis is, therefore, challenging in most cases.Area covered: Herein, the authors discuss different aspects of leukodystrophies. The authors used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR to provide an extensive update about epidemiology, classifications, pathology, clinical findings, diagnostic tools, and treatments of leukodystrophies. Comprehensive evaluation of clinical findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and genetic studies play the key roles in the early diagnosis of individuals with leukodystrophies. No cure is available for most heritable white matter disorders but symptomatic treatments can significantly decrease the burden of events. New genetic methods and stem cell transplantation are also under investigation to further increase the quality and duration of life in affected population.Expert opinion: The improvements in molecular diagnostic tools allow us to identify the meticulous underlying etiology of leukodystrophies and result in higher diagnostic rates, new classifications of leukodystrophies based on genetic information, and replacement of symptomatic managements with more specific targeted therapies.Abbreviations: 4H: Hypomyelination, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypodontia; AAV: Adeno-associated virus; AD: autosomal dominant; AGS: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome; ALSP: Axonal spheroids and pigmented glia; APGBD: Adult polyglucosan body disease; AR: autosomal recessive; ASO: Antisense oligonucleotide therapy; AxD: Alexander disease; BAEP: Brainstem auditory evoked potentials; CAA: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; CADASIL: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CARASAL: Cathepsin A-related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy; CARASIL: Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CGH: Comparative genomic hybridization; ClC2: Chloride Ion Channel 2; CMTX: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, X-linked; CMV: Cytomegalovirus; CNS: central nervous system; CRISP/Cas9: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated 9; gRNA: Guide RNA; CTX: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid; DSB: Double strand breaks; DTI: Diffusion tensor imaging; FLAIR: Fluid attenuated inversion recovery; GAN: Giant axonal neuropathy; H-ABC: Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum; HBSL: Hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity; HCC: Hypomyelination with congenital cataracts; HEMS: Hypomyelination of early myelinated structures; HMG CoA: Hydroxy methylglutaryl CoA; HSCT: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant; iPSC: Induced pluripotent stem cells; KSS: Kearns-Sayre syndrome; L-2-HGA: L-2-hydroxy glutaric aciduria; LBSL: Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and elevated lactate; LCC: Leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts; LTBL: Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate; MELAS: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke; MERRF: Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers; MLC: Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; MLD: metachromatic leukodystrophy; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NCL: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; NGS: Next generation sequencing; ODDD: Oculodentodigital dysplasia; PCWH: Peripheral demyelinating neuropathy-central-dysmyelinating leukodystrophy-Waardenburg syndrome-Hirschprung disease; PMD: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease; PMDL: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease; RNA: Ribonucleic acid; TW: T-weighted; VWM: Vanishing white matter; WES: whole exome sequencing; WGS: whole genome sequencing; X-ALD: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; XLD: X-linked dominant; XLR: X-linked recessive.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with a variety of cancers. Therefore, it is important to know the occurrence and prognostic effects of TP53 mutations in certain cancers. Methods: Over 29,000 cases from the April 2016 release of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 Database were analyzed to determine the distribution of germline and somatic mutations in the TP53 gene. Subsequently, 7,893 cancer cases were compiled in cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics from the 33 most recent The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies to determine the prevalence of TP53 mutations in cancers and their effects on survival and disease-free survival times. Results: The data were analyzed, and it was found that the majority of TP53 mutations were missense and the major mutational hotspots were located at codons 248, 273, 175, and 245 in exons 4-8 for somatic mutations with the addition of codon 337 and other mutations in exons 9-10 for germline mutations. Out of 33 TGCA studies, the effects of TP53 mutations were statistically significant in nine cancers (lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, uterine endometrial carcinoma, and thymoma) for survival time and in five cancers (pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, chromophobe RCC, acute myeloid leukemia, and thymoma) for disease-free survival time. It was also found that the most common p53 mutation in hepatocellular carcinomas (R249S) was a much better indicator for poor prognosis than TP53 mutations as a whole. In addition, in cases of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, the co-occurrence of TP53 and BRCA mutations resulted in longer survival and disease-free survival times than the presence of neither TP53 nor BRCA mutations. Conclusion: TP53 mutations are potential prognostic markers that can be used to further improve the accuracy of predicting survival and disease-free survival times of cancer patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nivolumab is Food and Drug Administration approved in sorafenib-experienced, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Post-registration data of treatment in a real-world setting is lacking. Patients and methods: We performed an international, multicenter observational study to confirm safety and efficacy of nivolumab in 233 patients treated outside clinical trials from eight centers in North America, Europe and Asia. Results: Patients received nivolumab for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C (n=191, 92.0%) and Child-Pugh (CP) A (n=158, 67.8%) or B (n=75, 32.2%) HCC as first (n=85, 36.5%) or second to fourth systemic therapy line (n=148, 63.5%). Objective response rate (ORR) was 22.4% and disease control rate was 52.1%. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.2 months (95% CI 8.4 to 16.0) and median progression-free survival was 10.1 months (95% CI 6.1 to 14.2). Treatment-related adverse events of grade >2 occurred in 26 patients (11.2%). Efficacy and safety were similar across CP classes and therapy line. OS was shorter in CP-B than A (7.3 months vs 16.3 months, p<0.001) and in post-first line use (10.4 months vs 16.3 months, p=0.05). Achievement of an objective response predicted for improved OS (25.4 months vs 13.2 months, p<0.001). Conclusions: This study confirms safety and efficacy of nivolumab in advanced HCC across various lines of therapy and degrees of liver dysfunction. Despite equal ORR and toxicity to nivolumab, patients with CP-B functional class have shorter survival than the patients with CP-A.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: Aberrant expression of miR-107 is involved in the development of several human cancers. However, the role of miR-107 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well documented. In the present study, we aim to explore the function of miR-107 in hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis was applied to predict the target genes of miR-107. Luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to verify the miR-107 binding sites in 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) mRNA. The expression levels of mRNA and protein were examined using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Functionally, MTT and EdU assays were carried out for proliferation analysis. Clinically, thirty HCC samples and their corresponding peritumor liver tissues were collected. Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-107 might target HMGA2 mRNA 3'UTR. Luciferase reporter gene assays verified that the miR-107 binding site was located in the 3'UTR of HMGA2 mRNA. Furthermore, miR-107 could down-regulate HMGA2 at the levels of mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, miR-107 inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma cells, while anti-miR-107 could promote the cell proliferation, which was blocked by the interference of HMGA2. Clinically, miR-107 was lower in HCC samples relative to peritumor liver tissues. The expression levels of miR-107 were negatively correlated with those of HMGA2 mRNA in HCC samples. Conclusion: MiR-107 suppresses the proliferation of hepatoma cells by targeting HMGA2 mRNA. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Heart failure and liver disease often coexist because of systemic disorders and diseases that affect both organs as well as complex cardio-hepatic interactions. Heart failure can cause acute or chronic liver injury due to ischaemia and passive venous congestion, respectively. Congestive hepatopathy is frequently observed in patients with congenital heart disease and after the Fontan procedure, but also in older patients with chronic heart failure. As congestive hepatopathy can evolve into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, screening for liver injury should be performed in patients with chronic cardiac diseases and after Fontan surgery. Fibrosis starts in the centro-lobular zone and will extend progressively to the portal area. Chronic liver injury can be reversible if heart function improves. However, in the case of terminal heart failure, uncontrolled by medical resources or by assistive device support, the combination of heart and liver transplants must be discussed in patients with chronic advanced liver fibrosis. In this review of the literature, we will focus on congestive hepatopathy and its complications, such as liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, with the aim of improving the management and surveillance of patients experiencing these complications.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Activating mutations of PIK3CA occur in various tumour types, including human hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanisms whereby PIK3CA contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis remain poorly understood. Methods: PIK3CA mutants H1047R or E545K were hydrodynamically transfected, either alone or in combination with NRasV12 or c-Met genes, in the mouse liver. Results: Overexpression of H1047R or E545K alone was able to induce AKT/mTOR signalling in the mouse liver, leading to hepatic steatosis. However, none of the mice developed liver tumours over long term. In contrast, H1047R or E545K cooperated with NRasV12 or c-Met to rapidly induce liver tumour formation in mice. At the molecular level, all the tumour nodules displayed activation of AKT/mTOR and Ras/MAPK cascades. Ablation of AKT2 significantly inhibited hepatic steatosis induced by H1047R or E545K and carcinogenesis induced by H1047R/c-Met or E545K/c-Met. Furthermore, tumourigenesis induced by H1047R/c-Met was abolished in conditional Raptor knockout mice. Conclusions: Both H1047R and E545K are able to activate the AKT/mTOR pathway. An intact AKT2/mTOR complex 1 cascade is required for tumourigenesis induced by H1047R/c-Met or E545K/c-Met in the liver.",

    "Abstract": "Upregulation of mouse double minute 4 (MDM4) is a frequent event in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly characterized. In this study a potential role of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) cascade was investigated in the regulation of MDM4 in HCC. Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT and/or mTOR pathways lowered MDM4 protein levels in HCC cells. Mechanistic protection from proteasomal degradation resulted from de-ubiquitination by ubiquitin-specific protease 2a and AKT-mediated phosphorylation of MDM4, thus increasing MDM4 protein levels. These findings were corroborated in a chimeric AKT mouse model. Upregulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling may result from overexpression of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A2 (EEF1A2). Finally, a strong association between the expression of EEF1A2, phosphorylated AKT and MDM4 was observed in human HCC samples. Strong activation of the EEF1A2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MDM4 signaling pathway was observed in HCC patients with short survival suggesting that targeting this axis might be a promising approach in a subset of HCC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Chloroform, a halogenated hydrocarbon, causes central nervous system depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and hepatotoxicity. We describe a case of chloroform ingestion with a confirmatory serum level and resultant hepatotoxicity successfully treated with intravenously administered N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A 19-year-old man attempting suicide ingested approximately 75 mL of chloroform. He was unresponsive and intubated upon arrival. Intravenously administered NAC was started after initial stabilization was complete. His vital signs were normal. Admission laboratory values revealed normal serum electrolytes, AST, ALT, PT, BUN, creatinine, and bilirubin. Serum ethanol level was 15 mg/dL, and aspirin and acetaminophen were undetectable. The patient was extubated but developed liver function abnormalities with a peak AST of 224 IU/L, ALT of 583 IU/L, and bilirubin level reaching 16.3 mg/dL. NAC was continued through hospital day 6. Serum chloroform level obtained on admission was 91 μg/mL. The patient was discharged to psychiatry without known sequelae and normal liver function tests. The average serum chloroform level in fatal cases of inhalational chloroform poisoning was 64 μg/mL, significantly lower than our patient. The toxicity is believed to be similar in both inhalation and ingestion routes of exposure, with mortality predominantly resulting from anoxia secondary to central nervous system depression. Hepatocellular toxicity is thought to result from free radical-induced oxidative damage. Previous reports describe survival after treatment with orally administered NAC, we report the first use of intravenously administered NAC for chloroform ingestion. Acute oral ingestion of chloroform is extremely rare. Our case illustrates that with appropriate supportive care, patients can recover from chloroform ingestion, and intravenously administered NAC may be of benefit in such cases.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are important contributors to the mortality gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. However, there is a lack of population based high quality data assessing the differences in HCC epidemiology and outcomes according to Indigenous status. The aim of this study was therefore to perform a large epidemiological study of HCC investigating differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians with HCC. Methods: Study design was a retrospective cohort study. Data linkage methodology was used to link data from cancer registries with hospital separation summaries across three Australian jurisdictions during 2000-2017. Cumulative survival (Kaplan-Meier) and the differences in survival (Multivariable Cox-regression) by Indigenous status were assessed. Findings: A total of 229 Indigenous and 3587 non-Indigenous HCC cases were included in the analyses. Significant epidemiological differences identified for Indigenous HCC cases included younger age at onset, higher proportion of females, higher rurality, lower socioeconomic status, and higher comorbidity burden (all p < 0.001). The distribution of cofactors was also significantly different for Indigenous Australians including higher prevalence of alcohol misuse, hepatitis B, and diabetes and more frequent presence of multiple HCC cofactors (all p < 0.001). Indigenous Australians received curative HCC therapies less frequently (6.6% vs. 14.5%, p < 0.001) and had poorer 5-year survival (10.0% vs. 17.3%, p < 0.001; unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) =1.42 96%CI 1.21-1.65) compared to non-Indigenous Australians. The strength of the association between indigenous status and survival was weaker and statistically non-significant after adjusting for rurality, comorbidity burden and lack of curative therapy (adjusted-HR=1.20 95%CI 0.97-1.47). Interpretation: Such data provide a call to action to help design and implement health literacy, liver management and HCC surveillance programs for Indigenous people to help close the liver cancer mortality gap.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to identify the prognostic factors associated with patient survival. Materials and methods: Fifty two patients who underwent TACE for infiltrative HCC were evaluated between 2007 and 2010. The maximum diameter of the tumors ranged from 7 cm to 22 cm (median 15 cm). Of 46 infiltrative HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis, 32 patients received adjuvant radiation therapy for portal vein tumor thrombosis after TACE. Results: The tumor response by European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria was partial in 18%, stable in 47%, and progressive in 35% of the patients. The median survival time was 5.7 months (Kaplan-Meier analysis). The survival rates were 48% at six months, 25% at one year, and 12% at two years. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, Child-Pugh class (p = 0.02), adjuvant radiotherapy (p = 0.003) and tumor response after TACE (p = 0.004) were significant factors associated with patient survival. Major complications occurred in nine patients. The major complication rate was significantly higher in patients with Child-Pugh B than in patients with Child-Pugh A (p = 0.049, χ(2) test). Conclusion: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization can be a safe treatment option in infiltrative HCC patients with Child Pugh class A. Child Pugh class A, radiotherapy for portal vein tumor thrombosis after TACE and tumor response are good prognostic factors for an increased survival after TACE in patients with infiltrative HCCs.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aim: Hepatic injury is a hallmark adverse reaction to Valproate (VPA), a common used drug in the management of numerous CNS disorders, including epilepsy. DHA has a myriad of health benefits, including renal- and hepato-protective effects. Unfortunately, however, the underpinnings of such liver-pertinent VPA- and DHA-actions remain largely undefined. Accordingly, this study attempted to unveil the cellular and molecular triggers whereby VPA evokes, while DHA abates, hepatotoxicity. Methods: We evaluated activity and/or expression of cellular markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in rat liver, following treatment with VPA (500 mg/kg/day) with and without concurrent treatment with DHA (250 mg/kg/day) for two weeks. Results and conclusion: VPA promoted hepatic oxidative stress as evidenced by enhancing activity/expression of NADPH-oxidase and its subunits, a ROS-generator, and by accumulation of lipid-peroxides. Moreover, VPA enhanced hepatic phosphorylation/activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and expression of cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2), as proinflammatory signals. Besides, VPA promoted hepatocellular apoptosis, as attested by enhanced expression of cleaved caspase-9 and increased number of TUNEL-positive hepatocytes. Lastly, VPA upregulated levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1α), a multifaceted modulator of hepatocytic biology, and activity of its downstream antioxidant enzyme heme-oxygenase-1(HO-1). These changes were significantly blunted by co-administration of DHA. Our findings demonstrate that VPA activated NADPH-oxidase and HIF-1α to induce oxidative-stress and hypoxia as initiators of hepatic injury. These changes were further aggravated by up-regulation of inflammatory (MAPK and COX-2) and apoptotic cascades, but could be partly lessened by HO-1 activation. Concurrent administration of DHA mitigated all VPA-induced anomalies.",

    "Abstract": "Patients (85%) with hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) are women taking oral contraceptives. They can be divided into four subgroups according to their genotype/phenotype features. (1) Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) biallelic somatic mutations are observed in 35% of the HCA cases. It occurs in almost all cases in women. HNF1alpha-mutated HCA are most of the time, highly steatotic, with a lack of expression of liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) in immunohistochemistry analyses. Adenomatosis is frequently detected in this context. An HNF1alpha germline mutation is observed in less than 5% of HCA cases and can be associated with MODY 3 diabetes. (2) An activating beta-catenin mutation was found in 10% of HCA. These beta-catenin activated HCAs are observed in men and women, and specific risk factors, such as male hormone administration or glycogenosis, are associated with their development. Immunohistochemistry studies show that these HCAs overexpress beta-catenin (nuclear and cytoplasmic) and glutamine synthetase. This group of tumours has a higher risk of malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma. (3) Inflammatory HCAs are observed in 40% of the cases, and they are most frequent in women but are also found in men. Lesions are characterised by inflammatory infiltrates, dystrophic arteries, sinusoidal dilatation and ductular reaction. They express serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein. In this group, GGT is frequently elevated, with a biological inflammatory syndrome present. Also, there are more overweight patients in this group. An additional 10% of inflammatory HCAs express beta-catenin, and are also at risk of malignant transformation. (4) Currently, less than 10% of HCAs are unclassified. It is hoped that in the near future it will be possible with clinical, biological and imaging data to predict in which of the 2 major groups (HNF1alpha-mutated HCA and inflammatory HCA) the patient belongs and to propose better guidelines in terms of surveillance and treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are benign liver tumors at risk of hemorrhage. The influence of pregnancy on HCA growth and potential bleeding remains unclear. This study investigates HCA-associated behavior and bleeding complications during or shortly after pregnancy. Methods: (I) Single center retrospective cohort study of HCA during and after pregnancy (II) Systematic literature review. Results: The retrospective study included 11 patients, of which 4 with HCA ≥5 cm. In only two patients HCA showed growth during pregnancy. In this local cohort, no HCA-related hemorrhages occurred during median follow-up of 34 months (interquartile range 19-58 months). The systematic review yielded 33 studies, totaling 90 patients with 99 pregnancies. Of 73 pregnancies without prior HCA-related intervention, 39 HCA remained stable (53.4%), 11 regressed (15.1%), and 23 (31.5%) progressed. Fifteen HCA-related hemorrhages occurred in HCA measuring 6.5-17.0 cm. Eight patients experienced bleeding during pregnancy, two during labor and five postpartum. Conclusion: Although hemorrhage of HCA during or shortly after pregnancy is rare and only reported in HCA ≥6.5 cm, it can be fatal. Pregnancy in women with HCA, regardless of size, warrant a close surveillance strategy. Observational studies on behavior and management of HCA ≥5 cm during and immediately after pregnancy are needed.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a rare benign tumor of the liver. A subtype classification of HCA (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α [HNF1α]-mutated, β-catenin-mutated HCA, inflammatory HCA, and unclassified HCA) has recently been established based on a single institutional review of a HCA series by the Bordeaux group. Methods: We used histologic and immunohistochemical parameters to classify and evaluate eight cases from our institution. We evaluated the new classification method and analyzed correlations between our results and those of other reports. Results: Seven of our eight cases showed histologic and immunohistochemical results consistent with previous reports. However, one case showed overlapping histologic features, as previously described by the Bordeaux group. Four cases showed glutamine synthetase immunohistochemical staining inconsistent with their classification, indicating that glutamine synthetase staining may not be diagnostic for β-catenin-mutated HCA. HNF1α-mutated HCA may be indicated by the absence of liver fatty acid binding protein expression. Detection of amyloid A may indicate inflammatory HCA. HCA with no mutation in the HNF1α or β-catenin genes and no inflammatory protein expression is categorized as unclassified HCA. Conclusions: Although the new classification is now generally accepted, validation through follow-up studies is necessary.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenoma (Hca) is a rare, benign, liver cell tumour. Hca is most frequently seen in women with a history of oral contraceptive use. Hca is also reported in children with glycogen storage disorders, galactosaemia, Hurler's syndrome, severe immune deficiency states, diabetes mellitus, sex hormone disturbances, Fanconis anaemia, in those who are on androgen therapy and also in seizure disorder patients who are on carbamazepine therapy. Usually, Hca arises typically in a clinical setting of hormonal or metabolic abnormalities which stimulate hepatocyte proliferation. Though it is rare, a few cases of spontaneous Hca have been reported in children and also in adults, which were not associated with any of the known risk factors which are associated with Hca. Hca has to be differentiated from focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastoma. The histological features and the assessment of cell proliferation by using immuno histochemistry, help in confirming the diagnosis of Hca. In a few cases of Hca, malignant transformations have been reported. Hence, a careful search for malignant transformations is necessary. In this report, we have documented two cases of spontaneous Hca which occurred in two normal children.",

Due to the scarcity of cases, there is no evidence-based algorithm for the evaluation and management of HCA during pregnancy. We think it should be questioned if it is justified to discourage pregnancy in all women with HCA. The biological behavior of this benign lesion might be less threatening than presumed and a negative advice concerning pregnancy has great impact on the lives of these young female patients. The balance between the pros and cons of hepatic adenomas and pregnancy should be reconsidered. In our center, pregnancy in women with an HCA up to 5 cm is no longer discouraged in close consultation with the patient, her partner, and members of the liver expert team.",

Methods: A total of 1,491 patients with first-time diagnosis of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A HCC, completely cured by treatment between 2007 and 2016, were recruited from two Korean tertiary institutes. Results: The mean age of the population (1,144 men and 347 women) was 58.6 years. Of the total population, 914 patients (61.3%) had liver cirrhosis. Nine-hundred and forty-one (63.1%) and 550 (36.9%) patients were treated with surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), respectively. One-year cumulative incidences of HCC recurrence were 14.3%, 9.9%, and 5.1% from the time of treatment, 3 years after treatment, and 5 years after treatment, respectively. Upon multivariate analysis, multiple tumors, maximal tumor size ≥3 cm, and high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores were independently associated with increased HCC recurrence risk from the time of treatment and 1 and 2 years after curative treatment (all p<0.05, except for maximal tumor size ≥3 cm for recurrence 2 years after treatment). Meanwhile, liver cirrhosis and RFA were independently associated with the increased HCC recurrence risk for almost all time points (liver cirrhosis: all p<0.05; RFA: all p<0.005 except for recurrence from 5 years after treatment). Conclusions: The recurrence rate of HCC after curative treatment gradually decreased over time. Two years after treatment, when tumor-related factors lose their prognostic implications, may be used as a cutoff to define the boundary between early and late recurrence of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Application of curative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma is crucially dependent on underlying liver function. Using the recently described ALBI grade we examined the long-term impact of liver dysfunction on survival of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Methods: This cohort study comprised 2559 HCC patients from different geographic regions, all treated with curative intent. We also examined the relation between indocyanine green (ICG) clearance and ALBI score. Survival was measured from the date of treatment to the date of death or last follow-up. Results: The ALBI score correlated well with ICG clearance. Among those undergoing surgical resection, patients with ALBI grade-1 (good liver function) survived approximately twice as long as those with ALBI grade-2 (less good liver function), although more than 90% of these patients were classified as Child-Pugh (C-P) grade A. In the cohort receiving ablative therapies, there was a similar difference in survival between ALBI grade-1 and grade-2. Cox regression analysis confirmed that the ALBI score along with age, gender, aetiology and tumour factors (AFP, tumour size/number and vascular invasion) independently influenced survival in HCC patients receiving curative treatments. Conclusions: The ALBI score represents a simple approach to the assessment of liver function in patients with HCC. After potentially curative therapy, those with ALBI grade-1 survived approximately twice as long as those with ALBI grade-2. These data suggest that ALBI grade-1 patients are appropriately treated with surgical resection whereas ALBI grade-2 patients may, where the option exists, be more suitable for liver transplantation or the less invasive curative ablative therapies.",

    "Abstract": "A clonal strain of epithelial cells (designated MH(1)C(1)) has been established from the transplantable Morris hepatoma No. 7795. The cells have maintained distinctive morphology throughout more than 20 subcultures (split 1:5) at 2- to 4-week intervals in supplemented Ham's F 10 medium. They contain many highly refractile, round, cytoplasmic bodies which stain bright red with Oil Red O. The population doubling time was 2 wk when the clonal strain was first established. It has gradually decreased to 1 wk. The cells synthesize rat serum albumin and secrete it into the culture medium as determined immunologically by microcomplement fixation and double diffusion. Albumin secretion (3-6 microg albumin/mg cell nitrogen/24 hr) occurs throughout the logarithmic phase of cell proliferation and has not diminished during serial propagation since the strain was initiated 15 months ago.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection persists in most infected individuals and can lead to the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a crucial role in various liver diseases, especially HCC. The expression profiles of circulating microRNAs have been studied aiming at the identification of novel non-invasive biomarkers. This study aims to develop a non-invasive diagnostic tool based on measuring the serum levels of different miRNAs in order to detect HCV-induced HCC at the early stages of the disease. Material and methods: Five main miRNAs (miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139, miRNA-145, and miRNA-199a) were selected according to the literature that demonstrated their unique expression pattern during HCC development. Serum samples were collected from 42 cases of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) without cirrhosis, 45 cases of CHC with cirrhosis (LC), 38 cases of HCC with HCV, and 40 healthy individuals serving as a control. The five miRNAs were measured using real-time reverse transcription PCR. The conventional HCC markers α-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) were measured with commercial kits. Results: Serum levels of miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139, miRNA-145, and miRNA-199a were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in HCC than in CHC and LC groups. As a single marker, miRNA-122a had the highest sensitivity for HCC, followed by miRNA-199a, miRNA-145, miRNA-139, and miRNA-125a. Conclusions: These findings indicate that measurement of serum levels of miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139, miRNA-145, and miRNA-199a can differentiate HCC from CHC and LC. Our results suggest that serum miR-122 might serve as a novel and potential noninvasive biomarker for HCV-induced HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) seems to be a rare event in hepatocarcinogenesis and might actually be associated with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in which the liver is often the site of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. The aim of this work was to define the MSI phenotype in HCC affecting exclusively normal livers to avoid slippage errors due to cirrhosis. One hundred and sixty-four patients with HCC affecting non-cirrhotic livers were operated on in our hospital between 1984 and 2001. We analyzed 37 patients selected for low alcohol consumption and the absence of HBV or HCV infection. All the livers were histologically normal. MSI was analyzed according to the criteria defined during the conference consensus workshop for colorectal cancer. High MSI (MSI-H > 30%) was found in 6 (16%) and low MSI (MSI-L < 30%) in 10 (27%) of the 37 HCCs. None of the 10 microsatellite markers tested were altered in the remaining 21 tumors (57%). Immunohistochemistry showed that normal amounts of hMLH1 and hMSH2 were present both in MSI-H and in MSI-L HCCs. MSI-H was significantly associated with more aggressive histological tumor features and a shorter median delay before recurrence. Thus, we have found a small subgroup of HCC tumors which can be considered as a new clinical/histological entity.",

    "Abstract": "Overall survival and recurrence rates after liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) vary, however observational data support the notion that patients with HCC have an overall worse long-term prognosis after LT compared to patients transplanted without HCC. Patient selection for LT in patients with HCC fluctuated as changes in the model for end-stage liver disease score was adjusted from 2002 to 2005. In the last decade, management of HCC patients on the waiting list has varied based on center experience. Since HCC patients have better access to the donor pool compared to non-HCC patients as evidenced by their lower dropout rate from the waiting list, living donation has been implemented in certain centers. Overall patient survival, recurrence free survival, and recurrence rates have been compared between living donor LT (LDLT) and deceased donor LT, with one meta-analysis reporting a lower disease free survival in LDLT, however overall patient survival and recurrence rates showed no difference at 1, 3 and 5 years. In patients exhibiting HCC recurrence, different modalities regarding immunosuppression and therapies have been evaluated. Currently there are no consensus treatment strategies regarding post-transplant HCC recurrence in patients not suitable for locoregional therapy, hence consideration of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors with the addition of sorafenib might be a feasible option with close monitoring in clinical practice despite the notable toxicities.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: In the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial, cabozantinib improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This subgroup analysis evaluated cabozantinib in patients who had received sorafenib as the only prior systemic therapy. Methods: CELESTIAL randomised (2:1) patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh class A liver function to treatment with cabozantinib (60 mg daily) or placebo. Eligibility required prior treatment with sorafenib, and patients could have received ≤2 prior systemic regimens. The primary endpoint was OS. Outcomes in patients who had received sorafenib as the only prior therapy were analysed by duration of prior sorafenib (<3 months, 3 to <6 months and ≥6 months). Results: Of patients who had received only prior sorafenib, 331 were randomised to cabozantinib and 164 to placebo; 136 patients had received sorafenib for <3 months, 141 for 3 to <6 months and 217 for ≥6 months. Cabozantinib improved OS relative to placebo in the overall second-line population who had received only prior sorafenib (median 11.3 vs 7.2 months; HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88). This improvement was maintained in analyses by prior sorafenib duration with longer duration generally corresponding to longer median OS-median OS 8.9 vs 6.9 months (HR=0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.10) for prior sorafenib <3 months, 11.5 vs 6.5 months (HR=0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.00) for 3 to <6 months and 12.3 vs 9.2 months (HR=0.82, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.16) for ≥6 months. Cabozantinib also improved PFS in all duration subgroups. Safety data were consistent with the overall study population. Conclusion: Cabozantinib improved efficacy outcomes versus placebo in the second-line population who had received only prior sorafenib irrespective of duration of prior sorafenib treatment, further supporting the utility of cabozantinib in the evolving treatment landscape of HCC.

    "Abstract": "The clinical significance of elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is not well defined. We analysed data from a population-based cohort of patients with HCV infection to assess the prevalence of elevated serum AFP, to determine its association with clinical and virologic parameters and with clinical outcomes. We defined a slightly elevated serum AFP level as 8 to <15 and a high-AFP level as > or =15 microg/L. Among 541 HCV-RNA-positive persons, 61 (11%) had a slightly elevated or high AFP at the time of consent. AFP > or =8 microg/L was associated with the older age, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio >1, and higher alkaline phosphatase levels, but not with heavy alcohol use, IV drug use, genotype, viral load or duration of HCV infection. Among 192 persons with an AFP at liver biopsy, 17% had an AFP > or =8 microg/L. The sensitivity/specificity of an AFP level > or =8 in detecting Ishak 3-6 fibrosis was 39%/95%. Among 372 persons with a minimum of four AFP measurements over 6 years, 5% had persistently elevated AFP >8 microg/L, 19% had both elevated and normal AFP measurements, and 76% had persistently normal AFP. Elevated AFP at consent was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and end-stage liver disease. Over 6 years of follow-up, persistently elevated AFP was associated with the development of HCC; no person with AFP persistently <8 microg/mL developed HCC. Serial AFP measurements appear to be useful in identifying persons with advanced fibrosis and help to determine who needs periodic screening with liver ultrasound to detect HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Although only a single gene exists for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), differential glycosylation generates several different forms and these are associated with different tissues of origin, namely, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and yolk sac. This microheterogeneity of serum AFP was studied in seven patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) in order to determine the tissue of origin of their elevated AFP levels. Concanavalin A (Con A), Lens culinaris agglutinin A (LCA-A), and erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA) affinity electrophoresis and antibody-affinity blotting were used to fractionate AFP. It was found that serum AFP in AT patients was composed mainly of Con-A band 2 (AFP-C2), LCA-A band 1 (AFP-L1), and E-PHA band 2 (AFP-P2). This profile of AFP species in AT patients is similar to those seen in neonates and patients with chronic hepatitis, but clearly different from AFP originating in hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and yolk sac tumour cells. These data are compatible with a hepatic origin for the elevated AFP in AT patients. Since no evidence exists for ongoing liver damage in these patients, we suggest that the AFP gene in the AT liver may be under aberrant transcriptional control, perhaps secondary to a defect of DNA regulatory proteins which are necessary for hepatic maturation.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Alpha-fetoprotein is often measured in subjects with chronic hepatitis C for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its prevalence and clinical significance remain inconclusive in subjects without hepatocellular carcinoma. The study was to assess the clinical, virologic, and histopathological significance of elevated AFP in chronic hepatitis C without the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methodology: The retrospective study enrolled 102 consecutive subjects with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C. None had evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma by image study at enrollment and for at least 6 months' follow-up. The correlation between serum alpha-fetoprotein level and clinical, virologic, or histopathological records was reviewed. Results: The prevalence of elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (> or = 13.6 ug/L) was 28.4% (29/102) in this study. Hepatic steatosis (> or = 5% hepatocytes), hepatic fibrosis (> or = stage II), uric acid > or = 6.3 mg/dL, asparate aminotransferase > or = 40 IU/L, albumin < 3.5 g/dL, and fasting plasma glucose < 126 mg/dL were significantly associated with elevated AFP in multivariate analysis. However, neither hepatitis C virus genotype Ib infection nor viral load > or = 1x10(6) copies/ml was related to elevated AFP. A serum alpha-fetoprotein level of 15.6 ug/L was 34.3% sensitive and 83.6% specific for hepatic steatosis, was 28.2% sensitive and 95.8% specific for > or = stage II hepatic fibrosis in Chronic hepatitis C. Conclusions: Elevated alpha-fetoprotein is independently associated with hepatic steatosis (> or = 5% hepatocytes), > or = stage II hepatic fibrosis, increased level of uric acid (> or = 6.3 mg/dL) or asparate aminotransferase (> or = 40 IU/L), and decreased level of albumin (< 3.5 g/dL) or fasting plasma glucose (< 126 mg/ dL).

    "Abstract": "Background/aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer death in the world. Of patients with HCC, the diagnostic capacity of Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) depends on its elevation in the serum. Concentration of AFP greater than the upper reference limit indicate the presence of HCC, but values below this level are less useful because they may also occur in chronic liver disease. To improve the sensitivity of HCC detection by AFP, this work was conducted to study serum expression of p53 Antibodies (p53 Abs) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGF) as a biomarkers in combination with AFP in patients with HCC. Methodology: The study included 67 patients with HCC (58 males and 9 females with a mean age of 53.7 years) and 27 patients with liver cirrhosis (23 males and 4 females with a mean age of 42 years). Ten healthy volunteers served as control group. Sera of all cases were examined for p53 Abs and VEGF by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and correlate its levels with serum AFP expression. Results: Serum level of p53 Abs was detected in HCC patients (0.54 +/- 23) with a significant elevation (p < 0.0001) than liver cirrhosis (0.26 +/- 0.1) and healthy individuals (0.21 = 0.068). The higher percentage of p53 Abs (73.07%) was detected in HCC patients than in liver cirrhosis (7.4%) (p < 0.0001). Serum expression of VEGF was significantly elevated (p < 0.0001) in HCC patients and in cirrhotic patients than healthy individuals (0.52 +/- 0.25, 0.55 +/- 0.25 vs 0.17 +/- 0.034) while there was no significant difference in VEGF between HCC and cirrhotic patients (p > 0.05). There was no association between either p53 Abs or VEGF and AFP concentrations. However, a greater incidence of VEGF and accumulation of p53 Abs expression was detected in positive cases for AFP where VEGF was detected in 85.3% and p53 Abs was detected in 83.3% of positive cases for AFP. Also, p53 Abs positive patients showed a significant high serum level of VEGF; so both can be used in association for screening of patients with HCC. Conclusion: It could be concluded that p53 Abs can be considered as an additional tumor marker to increase the diagnostic potential of AFP in HCC patients and VEGF may offer a novel diagnostic value for HCC.",

These included 144 with HCC, 47 with chronic hepatitis (fibrosis stage I-III on liver biopsy) and 49 with cirrhosis. Results: Levels of DCP, AFP and AFP L-3 were significantly higher in patients with HCC than in those without HCC (P < or = 0.0001). Receiver-operating curves (ROC) indicated that the cut-off value with the best sensitivity and specificity for each test was > or =84 mAU/mL for DCP, > or =25 ng/mL for AFP and > or =10% for AFP-L3. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for DCP was 87%, 85% and 86.8%, for AFP 69%, 87% and 69.8%, and for AFP-L3 56%, 90% and 56.1%, respectively. DCP levels were below the ROC cut-off in all patients without HCC. In patients with single lesions, there was a direct correlation of DCP to tumor size. High levels of AFP correlated with diffuse type of HCC. All three markers were significantly elevated in the presence of metastatic HCC. No advantage was observed by combining two or three markers for HCC diagnosis. Conclusion: DCP had the highest sensitivity and PPV for HCC diagnosis, had a direct correlation with tumor size, and was not elevated in any patients without HCC. DCP should be used as the main serum test for HCC detection.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) and Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) are surveillance markers used to detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan. This study evaluated their utility, alone or in combination, in a North American population. Methods: Patients with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis were followed up prospectively for 2 years. Results: Of 372 patients, HCC developed in 34 of 298 who were free of HCC at entry. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for only AFP (>20 ng/mL) were 61%, 71%, 34%, and 88%, respectively; for only AFP-L3% (>10) were 37%, 92%, 52%, and 85%, respectively; and for only DCP (>7.5 ng/mL) were 39%, 90%, 48%, and 86%, respectively. Values increased when AFP values were combined with AFP-L3% and DCP to 77%, 59%, 32%, and 91%, respectively. Among patients with increases in AFP levels to 20 to 200 ng/mL, AFP-L3% and DCP were highly specific markers (86.6% and 90.2%, respectively). Of 29 HCC patients with AFP levels less than 20 ng/mL, 13 had increased levels of AFP-L3% or DCP. Increased alanine aminotransferase levels were associated with increased total AFP but not AFP-L3% or DCP levels. Both AFP-L3%- and DCP-positive patients showed significant differences in lower cumulative HCC-free rates compared with the overall group (P < .0001 and P = .0005, respectively). Conclusions: AFP-L3% and DCP levels have higher correlation values with an absence of HCC, as well as a higher specificity and negative predictive value, than total AFP. Although this combination of markers only marginally improves surveillance for early HCC, it could identify individuals with negative imaging results who would benefit from follow-up evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: The clinical usefulness of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. This study aimed to assess the prognostic reliability of serum AFP levels per tumor volume (AFP/volume) after curative resection. Methodology: A total of 196 patients with HCC were analyzed with reference to serum AFP levels at diagnosis. Clinicopathological data included presence of cirrhosis, indocyanine green retention rate (ICGR15), tumor size and number of HCCs. Tumor volume for HCCs was calculated preoperatively by Computed tomography volumetry, and AFP/volume was calculated by dividing serum AFP level by tumor volume. Results: No significant correlation between serum AFP levels and presence of cirrhosis or ICGR15 was observed. A significant correlation existed between serum AFP levels and both size (P=0.001, r=0.276) and number (P=0.023, r=0.186) of HCCs. The 5-year survival rates in patients with low (< 200 ng/mL) and high (> or = 200 ng/mL) serum AFP level were 85.0% and 36.0%, respectively. AFP/volume tended to be negatively associated with survival period (p=0.084, r = -0.346), and a significant negative correlation existed between AFP/volume and disease-free survival period (p=0.001, r = -0.347). Median values of AFP/ volume in patients who displayed recurrence by 1 year and 6 months were 11.51 and 20.05, respectively. Conclusions: AFP/volume represents a better prognostic indicator for patients with HCC than serum AFP value alone. In particular, patients with AFP/volume > 20.0 are likely to experience recurrence within 6 months after curative hepatectomy.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is reportedly the main cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in India, where hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated HCC is believed to be relatively less prevalent. We verified the usefulness of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a tumor marker and analyzed the influence of viral etiology on AFP levels in HCC. Methods: Of a total of 1012 cases with liver disease, 202 were investigated for the presence of AFP (142 HCC cases, 30 cirrhosis cases, and 30 chronic liver disease (CLD) cases). In addition, serum samples from 30 healthy patients, 30 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers, and 30 acute viral hepatitis cases were included as controls. AFP was quantitatively determined using a commercial ELISA (Quorum Diagnostics, Canada). Out of the 142 HCC cases screened for AFP, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) detection was carried out in 38 HCC cases using an in-house immunoperoxidase test. Results: In HBV and HCV co-infected HCC cases, the AFP positivity was 85.7%. In HBV alone-associated HCC, the positivity was 62.9%, and 54.5% of AFB1 positive HCC cases showed AFP positivity. In HBV and HCV negative HCC cases, the positivity was 20.5%, and in HCV-associated HCC it was 17.6%. The HBV/HCV co-infected group and HBV alone positive HCC cases had significantly elevated levels of AFP. When AFP positivity was analyzed based on the marker profile of HBV, 89.7% of AFP positive cases were HBV-DNA positive. Conclusions: The overall positivity pattern of AFP in HCC does indicate that higher levels of AFP are observed with hepatitis virus positivity, especially with HBV. Further studies must be carried out to correlate the serum levels of AFP with the size, number, and degree of differentiation of HCC nodules.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: p53 antigen is an oncoprotective antigen and when damaged, leads to production of anti-p53 and also predisposes to various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Serum anti-p53 has been proven to have a prognostic value in patients with HCC. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and prognostic utility of serum anti-p53 in Egyptian patients with HCC. Methods: Forty one patients with HCC, 26 patients with liver cirrhosis and 29 healthy controls were included in this study. For all the studied groups, we studied the clinical data, abdominal ultrasound (US) findings, biochemical liver function tests, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit and anti-p53 antibody levels by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The severity of liver disease was assessed by Child-Pugh and MELD scores. Tumor characteristics were detected by (US) with or without computed tomography (CT) scan. These characteristics included tumor size, number and site. Tumor staging was done using Okuda, Cancer Liver Italian Program (CLIP) and Tokyo staging systems. Also, the overall survival of patients with HCC with reference to p53 antibody level was studied. Results: The mean age of HCC patients was 57.95+/-8.41. There was a male predominance among HCC patients with male-to-female ratio of 3.6:1. Anti-p53 antibodies were detected in the sera of 68.3% of HCC patients, 50% of liver cirrhosis patients and 17.2% of healthy control subjects. The data showed that HCC patients had a significantly higher mean anti-p53 antibody values (p=0.0001), than both liver cirrhosis patients and healthy control groups. Our results revealed that anti-p53 has a positive significant correlation with AFP (p=0.002), severity of liver disease [Child Pugh score (p=0.02) and MELD score (p=0.0003)], tumor size (p<0.0001), tumor number (p=0.003) and tumor staging systems [Okuda (p=0.04), CLIP (p=0.006) and Tokyo (p<0.0001)]. Also, our results revealed that serum anti-p53 antibodies had a significant association with overall survival of patients with HCC (p=0.019) with a shorter survival time in anti-p53 positive status patients and with higher anti-p53 antibody levels within 19 months follow up. Conclusion: The detection of anti-p53 antibodies may be suitable for assessing the prognosis of HCC patients. The higher percentage of positivity of anti-p53 antibodies in Egyptian control subjects than reported elsewhere needs further thorough investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is present in fetal serum in concentrations up to 5,000,000 μg/l. After birth, AFP gene expression is turned down with a subsequent fall of the serum concentrations of this albumin-like protein to 'adult values' of circa 0.5-15 μg/l from the age of 2 years onwards. Irrespective of its assumed important functions, individuals with AFP deficiency appear fully healthy. The other way around, the presence of AFP in the circulation after the first years of life doesn't seem to harm, since individuals with 'hereditary persistence of AFP' are also without clinical abnormalities. During pregnancy, AFP (in maternal serum) has long been recognized as a marker for congenital anomalies of the fetus. Equally well known is AFP as biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma and some other malignancies. There are at least four neurodegenerative disorders, all inherited as autosomal recessive traits and characterized by the presence of cerebellar ataxia, abnormal ocular movements, and neuropathy, for which an elevated concentration of serum AFP is an important diagnostic biomarker. The availability of a reliable biomarker is not only important during screening or diagnostic processes, but is also relevant for objective follow-up during (future) therapeutic interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) are well-known tumor markers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aims of this study are to calculate the sensitivity/specificity of AFP and DCP measurement for the diagnosis of HCC, measure response rates of the markers following curative-intent resections, determine the correlations between the marker levels and clinicopathological prognostic variables, and determine the correlations between the marker levels before hepatectomy and those at diagnosis of recurrence. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 714 consecutive patients with HCC undergoing hepatectomy was carried out. Results: The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.79 versus 0.91 for AFP and DCP, respectively (P < 0.001). Positive AFP and DCP status became negative at 6 months post surgery in 184/229 (80.3%) and 245/246 (99.6%) patients, respectively (cutoff values being 20 ng/ml for AFP and 40 mAU/ml for DCP; P < 0.0001). No correlation was found between marker levels (rs = 0.23). The level of DCP, but not that of AFP, showed a close correlation with tumor size (rs = 0.51 and 0.19, respectively). They were associated with indices of tumor invasiveness without showing any specific associations. AFP and DCP levels in patients showing recurrence in </=6 months correlated with the levels measured before surgery (rs = 0.78 and 0.49, respectively) but not in those showing recurrence after 2 years (rs = 0.31 and 0.30, respectively). Conclusions: DCP is a more accurate, albeit complementary, HCC marker than AFP. While the levels of both markers increased with advancing tumor growth, no specific associations were found. The marker values at recurrence indicated the type of recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The role of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a marker for treatment response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving systemic therapy is poorly defined. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on patients with advanced HCC enrolled in five phase II clinical trials. Serum AFP was prospectively collected at baseline and at different time points through treatment in parallel with radiologic response and clinical outcome. Patients were separated into three groups based on a 50% change in serum AFP from baseline. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and radiologic responses were compared between groups using log-rank and Wilcoxon tests. Results: Of 144 patients, 107 met the eligibility criteria. Eighteen patients experienced a >50% AFP decline, 57 patients had a >50% AFP increase, and 32 patients had a <50% change in serum AFP in either direction. Compared with patients with a <50% change in serum AFP (median PFS, 5.6 months), patients with a >50% AFP decrease had a longer PFS time (median, 16.9 months; p = .029), whereas those with a >50% increase had a shorter PFS time (median, 2.3 months; p = .038). Patients with a >50% rise in AFP had a shorter OS time than those with a <50% change (median, 6.3 months versus 11.1 months, respectively; p = .004), whereas a >50% AFP decrease was not associated with a significant difference in OS (median, 13.0 months; p = .87). AFP changes were significantly associated with radiologic response. Conclusions: Our study suggests that serum AFP change during treatment may serve as a useful surrogate marker for clinical outcome in patients with advanced HCC receiving systemic therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Surgical resection is the primary treatment for HCC; however, it is associated with a high rate of recurrence and death. We conducted this phase 2 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for HCC after narrow-margin hepatectomy. Approach and results: We designed a single-arm, prospective phase 2 trial to evaluate overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence patterns, and toxicity in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. The eligibility criteria included the following: pathological diagnosis of HCC after hepatectomy, with narrow pathological margins (< 1 cm); age > 18 years; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1. Patients received IMRT within 4-6 weeks after surgical resection. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01456156). Between 2008 and 2016, a total of 76 eligible patients who underwent narrow-margin resection were enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 70 months; the 3-year OS and DFS rates were 88.2% and 68.1%, respectively; and the 5-year OS and DFS rates were 72.2% and 51.6%, respectively. Intrahepatic recurrence was the primary recurrence pattern. No marginal recurrence was found. Intrahepatic, extrahepatic, and combined recurrences at the first relapse were found in 33, 5, and 1 patient, respectively. The most common radiation-related grade-3 toxicities were leukopenia (7.9%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (3.9%) and aspartate aminotransferase (2.6%) levels, and thrombocytopenia (1.3%). Classical or nonclassical radiation-induced liver disease was not noted. Conclusions: Adjuvant radiotherapy is an effective, well-tolerated, and promising adjuvant regimen in patients with HCC who have undergone narrow-margin hepatectomy. Our trial provides evidence and a rationale for planning a future phase 3 trial.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of the study was to identify whether melanoma antigen (MAGE)-1 mRNA and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) mRNA expressed in peripheral blood could be used to predict the recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy. Methods: One hundred and forty-two HCC patients underwent hepatectomy. The control group includes 27 patients with chronic virus hepatitis and cirrhosis and 10 healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood samples were collected on the seventh day before operation, seventh day after operation and 30th day after operation. MAGE-1 mRNA and AFP mRNA were tested by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Median follow up was 25.5 months (range 4-40 months). Patient survival, disease-free survival and clinicopathological features were compared between patients with positive and negative MAGE-1 mRNA and/or AFP mRNA. Results: The expression of MAGE-1 mRNA and/or AFP mRNA in peripheral blood was closely correlated to the pathological stage and the positive ratio of tumour cells in the peripheral blood (P < 0.01). There was recurrence and/or metastasis after operation in 55 of 142 HCC patients. Among the 55 patients who had recurrence or metastasis, MAGE-1 mRNA and/or AFP mRNA in peripheral blood were persistently detected after operation in 38 patients and MAGE-1 mRNA and AFP mRNA turned to positive after operation in 14 patients. In contrast, no recurrence was found in 62 patients whose MAGE-1 mRNA and/or AFP mRNA turned to negative after operation. 88.1% (52 of 59) of patients with MAGE-1 mRNA and/or AFP mRNA persistently positive after operation showed recurrence or metastasis, whereas only 3.6% patients (3 of 83) with the negative of MAGE-1 mRNA and/or AFP mRNA after operation showed recurrence or metastasis (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Melanoma antigen-1 mRNA combined with AFP mRNA in peripheral blood after hepatectomy is more sensitive and specific than AFP mRNA singly for predicting the recurrence and metastasis of the HCC patients, whereas preoperative transient detection is not.",

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is used for screening HCC, with limited success. Aim: We evaluated plasma chromogranin A (CgA) as a marker of HCC. Patients: CgA plasma levels and AFP serum levels were prospectively measured in 30 patients with HCC, 14 with cirrhosis, 79 with chronic hepatitis and 65 controls. Methods: CgA was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAKO A/S Glostrup, Denmark). AFP was measured by electrochemiluminoimmunoassay (Elecsys, Roche S.p.A., Italy). Results: CgA levels were significantly higher in the three groups of patients than in controls and in patients with HCC they were significantly higher than in chronic hepatitis patients [median 44.5 (interquartile range 21-145.9)U/L vs. 15.3 (10.9-29.25)U/L, p<0.001]. AFP values were above the upper reference limit in 75% of patients with HCC, 50% of cirrhotic patients and 11% of chronic hepatitis patients (p<0.005). CgA values significantly correlated with AFP levels (r(s)=0.42, p<0.0001).

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: There is no established clinical role for the lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3%) in the management of the Thai hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient population. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate clinical utility and performance characteristics of AFP-L3% for the diagnosis of HCC in Thai referral patients. Material and method: Sixty-one histologically proven HCC patients and 35 patients with other liver cancers were included for analysis. Results: The HCC population was comprised of 50 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 48.8 years. According to the Okuda system, three were classed as stage I, thirty-five belonged to stages II, and six were classified in stage III. An AFP-L3% a cut-off value of > 15% yielded a sensitivity of 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74-88%), specificity of 71% (95% CI, 58-82%), positive predictive value of 83% (95% CI, 75-90), and negative predictive value of 69% (95% CI, 56-80) for the diagnosis of HCC. In HCC patients with AFP of < 200 ng/ml, an AFP-L3% at a cut-off value of > 15% not only maintained high sensitivity of 83% and good specificity of 71% but also increased negative predictive value to 86% for the diagnosis of HCC. Conclusion: AFP-L3% provides high sensitivity but with lower sensitivity in the diagnosis of HCC than total AFP in individuals with symptomatic liver mass. However, considering its high negative predictive value in patients with AFP < 200 ng/ml, AFP-L3% might be useful as an adjunctive marker, in combination with AFP, to exclude the presence of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To explore the significance of Lens culinaris-reactive alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP-L3) detection in primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: AFP-L3 was isolated by using microspin column coupled with lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA), AFP and AFP-L3 were detected with chemiluminescent immunoassay, the proportion of AFP L3 levels were calculated, and the relationship between the elevated AFP-L3 (%) levels and benign and malignant liver disease was analyzed. Results: There were significant differences in positive rate between the patients of HCC, suspected HCC and other liver disease (81.80%, 73.68%, 11.80%, respectively, P < 0.05). Among the undetermined HCC (suspected HCC, liver disease) patients, 12 out of 21 cases of AFP-13 positive were diagnosed to be HCC within 6 months, and 6 of them were diagnosed to be the single small HCC at the early stage through B-Ultrasonic Diagnosis or CT. Among 62 cases of AFP-L3 negative, 3 cases were diagnosed to be HCC within 6 months and the risk of occurrence of HCC for AFP-L3 positive increased 11.9 times. Conclusion: AFP-L3 has no correlation with AFP value, and it can be used as an independent HCC diagnosis factor. The detection of AFP-L3 has a significant implication for the identification of benign or malignant liver disease and the early stage predictive diagnosis of HCC while AFP increases.",

Methodology: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 86 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and real-time Q-PCR technique was used to detect the MAGE-1, MAGE-3, and AFP mRNA in the blood. Results: In 86 tumor specimens, the positivity for MAGE-1, MAGE-3, and AFP genes was 34.9% (30/86), 60.5% (52/86) and 69.8%(60/86) respectively, and all specimens expressed at least one marker. MAGE-1, MAGE-3, and AFP transcripts were detected in 12 (14.0%),18 (20.1%) and 29 (33.7%) of 86 blood specimens from hepatocellular carcinoma patients, respectively, while 45 specimens (52.3%) were positive for at least one marker. In addition, MAGE-1, MAGE-3 and AFP gene transcripts were not detected in any peripheral blood specimens from 25 chronic liver disease patients and 28 normal healthy volunteers. The positive rate correlated with the TNM clinical stages, extrahepatic metastasis and portal vein carcinothrombosis (p<0.05). No correlation was found between tumor size, tumor number, differentiation, serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) and the positive rate. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a multimarker real-time Q-PCR assay with cancer-specific markers such as MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 in combination with a hepatocyte-specific AFP marker may be a promising diagnostic tool for monitoring hepato-cellular carcinoma patients with better sensitivity and specificity.",

Methodology: AFP and cytokine serum concentrations were determined via EIA or ELISA. Results: In total, 81 patients were included, including 9 healthy controls, 36 LC patients, and 36 HCC patients. Significant differences in AFP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-18 between the three groups were noted (p < 0.001). AFP was lowest in the healthy subjects, intermediate in LC patients and highest in HCC patients (all p < 0.001). 11-6 and 11-18 concentrations were significantly higher in the HCC group than the other two groups. HCC and LC patients with AFP concentration > 7ng/ml had increased IL-18 concentrations compared to both the other groups p < 0.001). In contrast to previously published studies, TNF-alpha was highest in the healthy group, intermediate in the HCC group, and lowest in the LC group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: IL-18 may be a potential tumour marker in combination with IL-6 and AFP in the diagnosis of HCC, but further research including a larger population of patients is essential.

    "Abstract": "Background/aim: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) are most widely used tumor markers in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, there have been some studies about them as prognostic markers in hepatitis C virus-associated HCC. However, prognostic values of AFP and PIVKA-II remain clarified in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC. This study was aimed to evaluate the prognostic values of AFP and PIVKA-II in HBV-associated HCC. Methods: Patients (n=126) were divided into 4 groups according to median levels of AFP and PIVKA-II (L; low/low, A; high/low, P; low/high, H; high/high) at diagnosis. Clinical characteristics and survival were compared among the groups, and Cox regression analysis was performed to find independent factors for survival. Results: Baseline host and viral factors were not significantly different among the 4 groups. High PIVKA-II groups (P and H) had more aggressive tumor characteristics (larger size of tumors, higher number of tumors, frequent portal vein thrombosis, P<0.05) and much shorter median survival time than low PIVKA-II groups (L and A) (P<0.05). In multivariate analysis, high PIVKA-II level was an independent predictor for survival (risk ration: 2.377, 95% confidence interval: 1.359-4.157, P=0.002) together with Child-Pugh score, advanced TMN stages, and treatment modality. Even after excluding 33 patients who had Child-Pugh class C and advanced tumor stages (tumor-nodes-metastasis stage III-IV) at diagnosis, high PIVKA-II level was still an independent predictor for survival (risk ration: 4.258, 95% confidence interval: 2.418-8.445, P<0.001). Conclusions: Serum PIVKA-II level, not serum AFP, was a valuable independent prognostic factor in HBV-related HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3%) has been reported to be useful in the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan. The aim of this prospective study was to compare the clinical utility of AFP-L3% with that of total AFP in North American patients. Methods: Patients with chronic hepatitis (CH) C virus-related cirrhosis from 7 clinical sites were prospectively followed every 3-6 months for 2 yr. Results: Of the 372 patients evaluated, 40 had hepatitis C virus-related HCC at entry and 332 entered the prospective trial. Of the latter, 34 developed HCC and 298 remained free of HCC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for AFP were 60.8%, 71.1%, 34.4%, and 88.0% with a cutoff of 20 ng/mL and 21.6%, 98.7%, 80.0%, and 83.5% with a cutoff of 200 ng/mL, compared to 36.5%, 91.6%, 51.9%, and 85.3% for AFP-L3% with a cutoff of 10%. In those with an elevated AFP (20-200 ng/mL), AFP-L3% had a specificity of 86.6% and an NPV of 80.7%. Multivariate analysis identified AFP, AFP-L3%, and age as independent predictors of HCC. Elevated AFP-L3% was associated with a lower cumulative HCC-free rate at 2 yr (58.9%) than was AFP (82.0%, P= 0.01). Conclusions: The incidence of HCC was significantly higher in patients with elevated AFP-L3% than in those with elevated AFP. The high specificity of AFP-L3% persisted among patients with elevated AFP (20-200 ng/mL) and suggests that AFP-L3% has clinical utility in HCV patients with AFP of 20-200 ng/mL.",

In this article, we describe an exceptional case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma that occurred in a 36-year-old man with a markedly elevated serum AFP level (12310.7 ng/mL). Histopathologic examination of surgically resected liver mass showed classic morphologic features of cholangiocarcinoma, with no hepatocellular carcinoma component identified. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were strongly and diffusely positive for AFP, CA19-9, and cytokeratin 19 and were negative for hepatocyte antigen. The patient's serum AFP level declined to 46.2 ng/mL 1 month after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of AFP-producing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with immunohistochemical evidence confirming the tumor cells to be the source of high-level AFP production.",

    "Abstract": "alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is considered to be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of AFP in the development of HCC is presently obscure. We hypothesized that a certain set of genes is expressed in a manner coordinate with AFP, and that these genes essentially contribute to the malignant characteristics of AFP-producing HCC. To address this hypothesis, we carried out global mRNA expression analysis of 21 liver cancer cell lines that produce varying levels of AFP. We identified 213 genes whose mRNA expression levels were significantly correlated with that of AFP (P < 0.0001). These included liver-specific transcription factors for AFP and other albumin family genes. Eighteen HCC-associated genes and 11 genes associated with malignancies other than HCC showed significant correlations with AFP production levels. Genes involved in lipid catabolism, blood coagulation, iron metabolism, angiogenesis, and the Wnt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways were also identified. Text data mining revealed that participation in the transcription factor network could explain the connection between 78 of the identified genes. Glypican 3, which is a component of the Wnt pathway and contributes to HCC development, had the fifth highest correlation coefficient with AFP. Reactivity to specific antibodies confirmed the significant correlation between AFP and glypican 3 expression in HCC tissues. These observations suggest that AFP-producing liver cancer cells may have a unique molecular background consisting of cancer-associated genes. From this genome-wide association study, novel aspects of the molecular background of AFP were revealed, and thus may lead to the identification of novel biomarker candidates.",

Sensitivity and specificity of AAG and its combination with AFP were determined and compared with AFP alone for the diagnosis of HCC. Results: The expression concentration of AAG was significantly higher in HCC patients than chronic liver disease with sensitivity (77%) and accuracy (83%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded the following AUC: AFP 0.750 (CI 95% 0.663-0.837), AAG 0.907 (CI 95% 0.855-0.960) and AFP+AAG 0.943 (CI 95% 0.897-0.988). At a specificity of 90%, the combination of AFP+AAG had sensitivity 89% and accuracy 90%, which was higher than sensitivity (52.3%) and accuracy (70%) when using AFP alone. Conclusion: The combination of AAG and AFP shows high sensitivity and improves the accuracy of HCC diagnosis.",

Methods: Western blotting was used to detect the serum GP73level in 25 patients being HBV carrier, 24 HCC patients, 12 patients with non-liver disease, and 99 healthy controls. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was detected by electrochemiluminescence reaction. The levels of sensitivity and specificity of serum GP73 in diagnosing HCC were compared with those of AFP. The serum GP73 levels of some HCC patients during the perioperative period were compared. Results: The serum GP73 level of the HCC patients, all HBV positive, was (40.36 +/- 64.43) relative units, significantly higher than those of the HBV carriers, non-liver patients, and healthy controls [(7.82 +/- 10.72), (4.48 +/- 5.70), and (2.59 +/- 5.12) relative units respectively, all P < 0.01]. There was no difference of GP73 levels between the healthy controls and the patients of non liver diseases (P = 0.2925). The sensitivity of GP73 for the diagnosis of HCC was 76.9%, significantly higher than that of AFP (48.6%). The specificity for the diagnosis of HCC of GP73 was 92.9%. Findings in a few HCC patients showed that the GP73 level remained not remarkably lowered within a week after surgical resection; but became lower 1.5-2 years after surgery. There was no raise of GP73 in the patients with non- malignant liver lesions. The GP73 levels of 4 of the 6 intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients were between those of the HCC patients and HBV carriers. Conclusion: Serum GP73 has higher sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of hepatitis B-related HCC than AFP, and it can become a new effective HCC tumor marker.",

Materials and methods: This study was a prospective, multicenter, registry-based, single-arm trial conducted at five university hospitals in Korea. Patients were recruited between May 2011 and April 2013, with a target population of 200. A DC Bead loaded with doxorubicin was used as the DEE agent. Patients were followed up for two years. Per-patient and per-lesion tumor response analysis, per-patient overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis, and per-lesion tumor control analysis were performed. Results: The final study population included 152 patients, with 207 target lesions for the per-lesion analysis. At one-month, six-month, one-year, and two-year per-patient assessments, complete response (CR) rates were 40.1%, 43.0%, 33.3%, and 19.6%, respectively. The objective response (OR) rates were 91.4%, 55.4%, 35.1%, and 19.6%, respectively. The cumulative two-year OS rate was 79.7%. The cumulative two-year PFS rate was 22.4% and the median survival was 9.3 months. In multivariable analysis, the Child-Pugh score (p = 0.019) was an independent predictor of OS, and tumor multiplicity (p < 0.001), tumor size (p = 0.020), and Child-Pugh score (p = 0.006) were independent predictors of PFS. In per-lesion analysis, one-month, six-month, one-year and two-year CR rates were 57.5%, 58.5%, 45.2%, and 33.3%, respectively, and the OR rates were 84.1%, 65.2%, 46.6%, and 33.3%, respectively. The cumulative two-year per-lesion tumor control rate was 36.2%, and the median time was 14.1 months. The Child-Pugh score (p < 0.001) was the only independent predictor of tumor control. Serious adverse events were reported in 11 patients (7.2%). Conclusion: DEE chemoembolization for nodular HCCs in the Korean population showed acceptable survival, tumor response, and safety profiles after a two-year follow-up. Good liver function (Child-Pugh score A5) was a key predictor of per-patient OS, PFS, and per-lesion tumor control.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Systemic chemotherapy is the only option for patients with unresectable/metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not candidates for local/regional treatment. However, the response to such treatment and survival are poor, especially in hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemic areas. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy and identify a subgroup of advanced HCC patients with favorable responses. Materials and methods: The medical records of all consecutive patients with unresectable/metastatic HCC who received cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy between January 2003 and October 2009 were reviewed. Time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for TTP and OS. Results: Data for 46 patients were analyzed. First-line chemotherapies consisted of cisplatin-based combination treatment with doxorubicin, fluoropyrimidines and gemcitabine. The response rate for all patients was 4.3%. The median TTP and OS were 1.8 (95%confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 2.5) and 7.2 (95% CI, 3.0 to 11.5) months, respectively. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), Child classification, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) were identified by univariate analyses as prognostic factors for TTP and OS. ECOG PS (hazard ratio [HR], 4.51; 95% CI, 1.61 to 12.6; p=0.004) and PVT (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.10 to 4.11; p=0.026) were independent prognostic factors for TTP. Conclusion: Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced HCC has a low response rate and short TTP regardless of the chemotherapy regimen used. Patients with a good ECOG PS and without PVT can be considered candidates for cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "The tumour suppressor gene, LKB1/STK11, has been mapped to chromosome 19p13, a region showing frequent allelic loss in various human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, LKB1 physically associates with p53 and regulates p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. To investigate whether genetic alterations of LKB1 could be involved in the tumorigenesis of HCC, we analysed the genetic alterations of the LKB1 and p53 genes in seven dysplastic nodules and 80 HCCs. We found one LKB1 missense mutation, CCG-->CTG (Pro-->Leu) at codon 281 within the kinase domain. We also found allelic loss in six of 27 (22%) informative HCC cases and all of them were HBV-positive cases. In addition, we detected seven missense, one nonsense and one silent mutations (nine of 80, 11%) of p53 in HCCs only. These results suggest that genetic alterations of the LKB1 or p53 genes may play an important role in tumour development or progression of a sub-set of HCCs, and may also provide alternative mechanisms to protect the HCC cell from p53-dependent apoptosis.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the HNF4alpha gene have been correlated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, which is characterized mainly by pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and is also associated with mild liver abnormalities. HNF4alpha D126Y and D126H mutations were found in a patient with early-onset type 2 diabetes, and the R324H mutation was found in a common type 2 diabetic nephropathic patient. We investigated whether these mutations, which have not yet been functionally characterized, impair HNF4alpha function in three cell models: HEK 293 embryonal kidney cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and betaTC3 pancreatic beta-cells. The R324H mutation had no effect on HNF4alpha function with either the HNF1alpha and L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) promoters, but the D126Y and D126H mutations impaired HNF4alpha transcriptional activities in all tested cell lines. These impairments by D126Y and D126H mutations, which are located in the T box, are not due to a loss of dimerization but to a loss of DNA binding. Interestingly, the strongest functional consequences of these mutations were observed on the HNF1alpha promoter in betaTC3 cells. Given the key role of the transcription factor HNF1alpha in pancreatic beta-cell function, it can be inferred that impairment of HNF4alpha function by these mutations affects metabolic pathways in pancreatic beta-cells and contributes to development of diabetes. Moreover, the HNF4alpha-mediated activation of the apolipoprotein CIII promoter in HepG2 cells was significantly impaired by D126Y and D126H mutations. These results support clinical findings that liver function can also be impaired in diabetic patients having HNF4alpha mutations.",

    "Abstract": "The hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4alpha, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, regulates genes that play a critical role in embryogenesis and metabolism. Recent studies have shown that mutations in the human HNF4alpha gene cause a rare form of type 2 diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY1). To investigate the properties of these naturally occurring HNF4alpha mutations we analysed five MODY1 mutations (R154X, R127W, V255M, Q268X and E276Q) and one other mutation (D69A), which we found in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Activation of reporter genes in transfection assays and DNA binding studies showed that the MODY1-associated mutations result in a variable reduction in function, whereas the D69A mutation showed an increased activity on some promoters. None of the MODY mutants acted in a dominant negative manner, thus excluding inactivation of the wild-type factor as a critical event in MODY development. A MODY3-associated mutation in the HNF1alpha gene, a well-known target gene of HNF4alpha, results in a dramatic loss of the HNF4 binding site in the promoter, indicating that mutations in the HNF4alpha gene might cause MODY through impaired HNF1alpha gene function. Based on these data we propose a two-hit model for MODY development.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and arterioportal shunts (APSs). Materials and methods: Fifty-eight patients with unresectable HCC and APSs who were treated with DEB-TACE (n=26) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) plus TACE (PVA-TACE, n=32) were included in this retrospective study. The tumor response was evaluated by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Toxicity was graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) and compared between the two groups. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test between the two groups. The influence of potential prognostic factors on survival in the DEB-TACE group was analyzed via a multivariate Cox regression model. Results: The disease control rate was better in the DEB-TACE group than in the PVA-TACE group. The median survival times were 346 and 274 days in the DEB-TACE group and PVA-TACE group, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival rates between the two groups (P=0.081). Patients treated with DEB-TACE were significantly less likely to have fever (P=0.048) or a low-grade (grade 1-2) increase in transaminases (P=0.046) than the patients treated with PVA-TACE. The potential predictive prognostic factors in the DEB-TACE group were tumor response, APS grading, and serum bilirubin. Conclusion: DEB-TACE may be feasible and safe in HCC patients with APS. Survival in the DEB-TACE group was associated with tumor response, APS grading, and serum bilirubin levels.",

    "Abstract": "In 2020, international consensus guidelines recommended the renaming of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), supported by diagnostic criteria. MAFLD affects up to 25% of the global population. However, the rates of MAFLD are likely to be underestimated due to the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Within the next decade, MAFLD has been projected to become a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide, as well as the most common indication for liver transplantation in the US. This transition in terminology and clinical criteria may increase momentum and clinical evidence at multiple levels, including patient diagnosis, management, and care, and provide the basis for new research areas and clinical development for therapeutics. The diagnostic criteria for MAFLD are practical, simple, and superior to the existing NAFLD criteria for identifying patients at increased risk of developing progressive liver disease. This Editorial aims to present the historical evolution of the terminology for fatty liver disease and the advantages of diagnosis, patient management, and future research on MAFLD.",

This syndrome is also frequently associated with brain, cardiovascular, and urinary anomalies and is occasionally accompanied by malignant lesions such as Wilms tumour and hepatocarcinoma. The syndrome is known to be caused by mutations or deletions of the NSD1 gene. To detect both 5q35 microdeletions and partial NSD1 gene deletions we screened 30 Brazilian patients with clinical diagnosis of Sotos syndrome by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. We identified one patient with a total deletion of NSD1 and neighbouring FGFR4, other with missing NSD1 exons 13-14 and another with a deletion involving FGFR4 and spanning up to NSD1 exon 17. All deletions were de novo. The two NSD1 partial deletions have not been previously reported. The clinical features of the three patients included a typical facial gestalt with frontal bossing, prominent jaw and high anterior hairline; macrocephaly, dolichocephaly, large hands; neonatal hypotonia and jaundice. All presented normal growth at birth but postnatal overgrowth. Two patients with NSD1 and FGFR4 gene deletions presented congenital heart anomalies.",

    "Abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits cell cycle progression, in part through up-regulation of gene expression of the p21(WAF1/Cip1) (p21) cell cycle inhibitor. Previously we have reported that the intracellular effectors of TGF-beta, Smad3 and Smad4, functionally cooperate with Sp1 to activate the human p21 promoter in hepatoma HepG2 cells. In this study we show that Smad3 and Smad4 when overexpressed in HaCaT keratinocytes lead to activation of the p21 promoter. Activation requires the binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 on the proximal promoter. Induction of the endogenous HaCaT p21 gene by TGF-beta1 is further enhanced after overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4, whereas dominant negative mutants of Smad3 and Smad4 and the inhibitory Smad7 all inhibit p21 induction by TGF-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner. We show that Sp1 expressed in the Sp1-deficient Drosophila SL-2 cells binds to the proximal p21 promoter sequences, whereas Smad proteins do not. In support of this finding, we show that DNA-binding domain mutants of Smad3 and Smad4 are capable of transactivating the p21 promoter as efficiently as wild type Smads. Co-expression of Smad3 with Smad4 and Sp1 in SL-2 cells or co-incubation of phosphorylated Smad3, Smad4, and Sp1 in vitro results in enhanced binding of Sp1 to the p21 proximal promoter sequences. We demonstrate that Sp1 physically and directly interacts with Smad2, Smad3, and weakly with Smad4 via their amino-terminal (Mad-Homology 1) domain. Finally, by using GAL4 fusion proteins we show that the glutamine-rich sequences in the transactivation domain of Sp1 contribute to the cooperativity with Smad proteins. In conclusion, Smad proteins play important roles in regulation of the p21 gene by TGF-beta, and the functional cooperation of Smad proteins with Sp1 involves the physical interaction of these two types of transcription factors.",

To test the hypothesis that genetic variants in the key subunits of SWI/SNF complexes may contribute to HCC susceptibility, we systematically assessed associations of genetic variants in SWI/SNF complexes with HCC risk using a two-staged case-control study in Chinese population. A set of 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SWI/SNF complexes were examined in stage 1 with 502 HCC patients and 487 controls and three promising SNPs (SMARCA4 rs11879293, rs2072382 and SMARCB1 rs2267032) were further genotyped in stage 2 comprising 501 cases and 545 controls for validation. SMARCA4 rs11879293 presented consistently significant associations with the risk of HCC at both stages, with an OR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62-0.87) using additive model in combined analysis. Moreover, the decreased risk of HCC associated with SMARCA4 rs11879293 AG/AA was more evident among HBsAg positive individuals (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.80) in combined analysis.

Methods: Databases in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China BioMedicine, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Meta-analyses were performed to examine the association of the miR-196a2 C>T and miR-499 A>G polymorphisms with HBV-related HCC risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Results: A total of 13 studies involving 3,964 cases and 5,875 healthy controls were included. Random-effect meta-analysis showed that the T allele and TT genotype of miR-196a2 C>T were associated with significantly lower HBV-related HCC risk (allelic model, OR =0.84, 95% CI =0.71-0.99, P=0.04; homozygous model, OR =0.68, 95% CI =0.47-0.98, P=0.04). In contrast, miR-499 A>G showed no significant association with HBV-related HCC risk in either overall pooled analysis or ethnic subgroup analysis according to any of the four genetic models. Based on analysis of ethnic subgroups, neither miR-196a2 C>T nor miR-499 A>G was significantly associated with risk of HBV-related HCC in Chinese population. Conclusion: The polymorphism miR-196a2 C>T, but not miR-499 A>G, may be associated with decreased HBV-related HCC risk. These conclusions should be verified in large, well-designed studies.",

The APC gene has been found to be altered by point mutations in the germ line of both adenomatous polyposis coli and Gardner's syndrome patients and somatically in tumors from sporadic colorectal cancer patients. During the hunt for the APC gene, the closely linked MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer) gene was identified and found to be altered somatically in tumors from sporadic cancer patients. These data suggest that more than one gene on chromosome 5q21 may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis and that mutations at the APC gene can cause both adenomatous polyposis coli and Gardner's syndrome. The identification of these genes should aid in the counseling of patients with genetic predispositions to colorectal cancer. Progress has also been made in identifying specific genetic changes that occur in other gastrointestinal cancers. A mutational \"hotspot\" in the p53 gene in human hepatocellular carcinomas has been identified that could reflect exposure to a specific carcinogen, one candidate being aflatoxin B1.",

    "Abstract": "Rationale: PMS1 is one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes with potential crucial roles in carcinogenesis. Very few reports have been identified on germline PMS1 mutations with definite disease phenotype. Here we report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a novel potential pathogenic germline PMS1 mutation. Patient concerns: A 46-year-old Chinese male with Hepatitis B infection history presented a single cancerous nodule (10×12×10 mm) at the left lobe of liver. The nodule was considered malignant by type-B ultrasonic and computed tomography (CT) examinations. Diagnosis and intervention: Liver lobectomy was performed to remove the liver cancerous nodule and postoperative TACE was performed for recurrence prevention. Pathological examination on resected tumor tissue confirmed the diagnosis of HCC. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified the c.900delT (p.D300fs) heterozygous germline mutation of PMS1, along with 253 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs), 14 Insertion or deletion mutations (INDELs) and 21 genes with copy number variations (CNVs). Three-dimensional prediction of protein tertiary structure suggested that the conformation of the enzyme active site and the ligand binding site might be changed due to the protein truncation. Outcomes: The patient was still alive in good condition with no sign of recurrence in 12 months follow-up period. Lessons: The affected pathways in this case were unique from previously reported HCC patients with no PMS1 germline mutations. The novel PMS1 germline mutation may increase cancer risk. The roles of PMS1 germline mutations in carcinogenesis need further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been widely used during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. Purpose: To evaluate the sensitivity of CBCT for the detection of hepatocellular carcinomas and the tumor feeders by comparing celiac artery (CA) and common hepatic artery (CHA) injection. Material and methods: We retrospectively enrolled 30 patients (52 hepatocellular carcinoma lesions) who had undergone CBCT-assisted transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. In 17 procedures (28 hepatocellular carcinomas) we acquired CBCT scans using CA injections (CBCT-CA) and in 18 (24 hepatocellular carcinomas) we used CHA injections (CBCT-CHA). Of the 30 patients, 5 underwent CBCT-CA and CBCT-CHA at different transcatheter arterial chemoembolization procedures. We performed inter-group comparisons of the detectability of hepatocellular carcinoma, the feeding artery, the intrahepatic artery branch order, and the tumor-to-liver contrast. Results: CBCT-CA detected all 28 hepatocellular carcinomas and 27 of their feeders (96.4%); CBCT-CHA identified 22 of 24 hepatocellular carcinomas (91.7%) and 21 of their feeders (95.5%). There was no significant inter-group difference in the detectability of hepatocellular carcinoma lesions (p = 0.21) or feeding arteries (p = 0.69). CBCT-CHA was superior for the assessment of the tumor-to-liver contrast and the intrahepatic artery branch order (both: p < 0.01). Conclusion: CBCT-CA and CBCT-CHA were equally useful for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma and of the feeding artery, although CBCT-CHA yields better visualization of hepatocellular carcinoma and the hepatic artery. Thus CA injection seems sufficient for lesion and vessel detection when the insertion of an angiographic catheter into the CHA is difficult.",

    "Abstract": "SPHK1 (sphingosine kinase 1), a regulator of sphingolipid metabolites, plays a causal role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through augmenting HCC invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which SPHK1 signaling promotes invasion and metastasis in HCC remains to be clarified. Here, we reported that SPHK1 induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by accelerating CDH1/E-cadherin lysosomal degradation and facilitating the invasion and metastasis of HepG2 cells. Initially, we found that SPHK1 promoted cell migration and invasion and induced the EMT process through decreasing the expression of CDH1, which is an epithelial marker. Furthermore, SPHK1 accelerated the lysosomal degradation of CDH1 to induce EMT, which depended on TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor 2)-mediated macroautophagy/autophagy activation. In addition, the inhibition of autophagy recovered CDH1 expression and reduced cell migration and invasion through delaying the degradation of CDH1 in SPHK1-overexpressing cells. Moreover, the overexpression of SPHK1 produced intracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). In response to S1P stimulation, TRAF2 bound to BECN1/Beclin 1 and catalyzed the lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1 for triggering autophagy. The deletion of the RING domain of TRAF2 inhibited autophagy and the interaction of BECN1 and TRAF2. Our findings define a novel mechanism responsible for the regulation of the EMT via SPHK1-TRAF2-BECN1-CDH1 signal cascades in HCC cells. Our work indicates that the blockage of SPHK1 activity to attenuate autophagy may be a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Extrahepatic metastasis (EHM) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increasingly been seen due to improved survival with effective management of intrahepatic lesions. The presence of EHM indicates an advanced stage of HCC, for which systemic therapy serves as the standard treatment modality. Since the approval of Sorafenib as the first systemic agent in 2007, it took almost a decade to show its efficacy in both first and further lines of setting until the landscape of systemic drugs was finally expanded. Moreover, with inspiring results from immunotherapy trials in HCC, it appears that the introduction of immunotherapy may lead to an evolution in the portfolio of HCC treatment. Although the locoregional approach in the management of EHM is not recommended for advanced-stage HCC, efforts have been made to demonstrate its efficacy in symptom relief and potential benefit for overall survival. This review provides a summary of recent updates of the systemic agents in the treatment of advanced HCC, with an emphasis on aggressive locoregional management of EHM by various treatment modalities.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To evaluate the inhibitory effects of deferasirox (DFX) against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through basic and clinical studies. Methods: In the basic study, the effect of DFX was investigated in three hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7), as well as in an N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced murine HCC model. In the clinical study, six advanced HCC patients refractory to chemotherapy were enrolled. The initial dose of DFX was 10 mg/kg per day and was increased by 10 mg/kg per day every week, until the maximum dose of 30 mg/kg per day. The duration of a single course of DFX therapy was 28 consecutive days. In the event of dose-limiting toxicity (according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0), DFX dose was reduced. Results: Administration of DFX inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma cell lines and induced the activation of caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In the murine model, DFX treatment significantly suppressed the development of liver tumors (P < 0.01), and significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of hepcidin (P < 0.05), transferrin receptor 1 (P < 0.05), and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (P < 0.05) in both tumor and non-tumor tissues, compared with control mice. In the clinical study, anorexia and elevated serum creatinine were observed in four and all six patients, respectively. However, reduction in DFX dose led to decrease in serum creatinine levels in all patients. After the first course of DFX, one patient discontinued the therapy. We assessed the tumor response in the remaining five patients; one patient exhibited stable disease, while four patients exhibited progressive disease. The one-year survival rate of the six patients was 17%. Conclusion: We demonstrated that DFX inhibited HCC in the basic study, but not in the clinical study due to dose-limiting toxicities.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Microvascular invasion (MVI) is an important prognostic factor affecting early recurrence and overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatectomy and liver transplantation, but it can be determined only in surgical specimens. Accurate preoperative prediction of MVI is conducive to clinical decisions. Aim: To develop and validate a preoperative prediction model for MVI in patients with HCC. Methods: Data from 454 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between May 2016 and October 2019 were retrospectively collected. Then, the patients were nonrandomly split into a training cohort and a validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables significantly associated with MVI that were then included in the nomogram. We evaluated the discrimination and calibration ability of the nomogram by using R software. Results: MVI was confirmed in 209 (46.0%) patients by a pathological examination. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four risk factors independently associated with MVI: Tumor size [odds ratio (OR) = 1.195; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.107-1.290; P < 0.001], number of tumors (OR = 4.441; 95%CI: 2.112-9.341; P < 0.001), neutrophils (OR = 1.714; 95%CI: 1.036-2.836; P = 0.036), and serum α-fetoprotein (20-400 ng/mL, OR = 1.955; 95%CI: 1.055-3.624; P = 0.033; >400 ng/mL, OR = 3.476; 95%CI: 1.950-6.195; P < 0.001). The concordance index was 0.79 (95%CI: 0.74-0.84) and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.74-0.89) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curves showed good agreement between the predicted risk by the nomogram and real outcomes. Conclusion: We have developed and validated a preoperative prediction model for MVI in patients with HCC. The model could aid physicians in clinical treatment decision making.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: TLPL/AY/03/2008 is a polyherbal formulation intended for treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lumbago, spondylitis etc., Acute and repeated dose 90-days studies were conducted to evaluate the safety profile of TLPL/AY/03/2008 in rats. Materials and methods: In acute study, TLPL/AY/03/2008 was orally administered to Sprague Dawley rats at 2000 mg/kg. In repeated dose study, TLPL/AY/03/2008 was administered to rats at 200, 500 and 1000 mg/kg through oral gavage for 90 days and assessed for treatment related changes in body weight, feed consumption, hematological, biochemical and pathological parameters. Histopathological examination was conducted for tissues from control and the high dose groups and was extended to target organs from the lower dose and recovery groups. Results: In acute study, the test item did not produce any mortality or adverse clinical signs. In the 90-days oral toxicity study, animals did not exhibit any toxicity symptoms and no deaths were observed. No significant changes were found in hematological and biochemical endpoints. Also, toxicologically significant alterations in relative organ weights were not observed. Microscopic findings of mild to marked, diffuse hepatocellular degeneration (vacuolar changes with granular of cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei of hepatocytes) was noticed in males at 1000 mg/kg body weight. Animals of recovery group (1000 mg/kg) did not show any changes when compared with control group animals indicating the complete reversal. Conclusions: Based on the findings of the study, the median lethal dose of TLPL/AY/03/2008 was found to be more than 2000 mg/kg. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of TLPL/AY/03/2008 can be considered as 1000 mg/kg in both male and female rats, under the experimental conditions and doses employed.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most lethal malignancy worldwide. There has been virtually no change in the survivability of HCC in spite of improvement in therapies. Surgery is considered the ideal first, curative intervention, however most patients present in advanced stages with unresectable disease. Therefore, systemic and liver-directed non-operative therapies are initially offered to downstage the disease. To ensure optimal management, a multidisciplinary team approach is often warranted. Our case highlights the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach in a young woman with multifocal, bilobar HCC. Case summary: A 36-year-old Chinese woman with untreated hepatitis B was found to have large bilobar HCC during work up for abdominal pain. Her initial serum alpha-fetoprotein was significantly elevated to 311136 ng/mL. Computed tomography scan demonstrated bulky bilobar liver masses, consistent with intermediate stage HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B. Her case was discussed and a personalized care plan was developed at the Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Minimally Invasive Liver Oncologic Therapies at the University of Washington. She initially underwent bilobar transarterial chemoembolization with partial response of the left lobar tumor. Salvage hypofractionated proton beam radiation therapy was delivered to the right lobe followed by two additional transarterial chemoembolizations to the left lobe with good response. Finally, to remove left lobar residual disease, she was taken to the operating room for a left hepatectomy eleven months after her initial presentation. She continues to be without evidence of disease. Conclusion: Coordinating the multiple HCC treatment modalities is complex and our case highlights the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Limited information is available regarding patient survival after sorafenib discontinuation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, we developed and validated a novel survival prediction model. Methods: Clinical data from 409 patients with HCC who stopped taking sorafenib between September 2008 and February 2015 were reviewed. Results: In the training cohort, four factors were independent negative predictors of survival (p<0.05). Based on the β regression coefficient of each factor, we established the NEXT score (Survival after Stopping Nexavar Treatment), allocating 1 point each for an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score ≥2, Child-Pugh class B or C, serum sodium ≤135 mEq/L, and α-fetoprotein 〉400 ng/mL. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values to predict 1-, 3-, and 6-month survival rates were 0.805, 0.809, and 0.774, respectively, in the training cohort and 0.783, 0.728, and 0.673, respectively, in the validation cohort (n=137). When the training and validation cohorts were stratified into three risk groups (NEXT score 0 [low-risk] vs 1 to 2 [intermediate-risk] vs 3 to 4 [high-risk]), survival differed significantly between the groups (p＜0.05, log-rank test). Conclusions: In patients with HCC, survival after stopping sorafenib is poor. However, risk estimates based on a new \"NEXT score\" may help predict survival and prognosis even in patients who discontinue sorafenib treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an important therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis. In particular in advanced cirrhosis, post-TACE hepatic failure liver (PTHF) failure may develop. Currently, there is no standardization for the periinterventional risk assessment. The liver maximum capacity (LiMAx) test assesses the functional liver capacity, but has not been investigated in this setting. Aims: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate periinterventional LiMAx and CT volumetry measurements in patients with cirrhosis and HCC undergoing repetitive TACE. Methods: From 06/2016 to 11/2017, eleven patients with HCC and cirrhosis undergoing TACE were included. LiMAx measurements (n = 42) were conducted before and after each TACE. Laboratory parameters were correlated with the volume-function data. Results: The median LiMAx levels before (276 ± 166 µg/kg/h) were slightly reduced after TACE (251 ± 122 µg/kg/h; p = 0.08). This corresponded to a median drop of 7.1%. Notably, there was a significant correlation between LiMAx levels before TACE and bilirubin (but not albumin nor albumin-bilirubin [ALBI] score) increase after TACE (p = 0.02, k = 0.56). Furthermore, a significantly higher increase in bilirubin in patients with LiMAx ≤ 150 µg/kg/h was observed (p = 0.011). LiMAx levels at different time points in single patients were similar (p = 0.2). Conclusion: In our prospective pilot study in patients with HCC and cirrhosis undergoing multiple TACE, robust and reliable LiMAx measurements were demonstrated. Lower LiMAx levels before TACE were associated with surrogate markers (bilirubin) of liver failure after TACE. Specific subgroups at high risk of PTHF should be investigated. This might facilitate the future development of strategies to prevent occurrence of PTHF.",

Utilizing selective absorption procedures it was demonstrated that each subcellular membrane fraction possessed unique autoantigenic activity with little or no cross-reactivity between the various membrane fractions. It is proposed that the development of membrane-specific autoantibodies may provide an immunological marker useful in the differential characterization of various subcellular membranes.",

    "Abstract": "There is ongoing evidence that vitamin D is related to the pathophysiology of cirrhosis. Although the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis is strongly documented, its pathogenic association with advanced liver fibrosis remains controversial. There is evidence of a significant relation of 25(OH)D levels with the degree of liver dysfunction, considering that an inverse correlation of 25(OH)D levels with both Child-Pugh score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease has been reported. In addition, vitamin D deficiency has been shown to increase the risk for overall mortality and infections in patients with cirrhosis. Vitamin D deficiency has been also associated with advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma and poor prognosis. Finally, there are studies suggesting that patients with chronic hepatitis C and normal vitamin D levels have higher virological response to treatment. However, there are not enough studies conducted in cirrhotic-only populations. The association between vitamin D and cirrhosis demonstrates a great potential for clinical application. The relation between vitamin D deficiency and the degree of liver function, degree of fibrosis and infectious complications could support its use as a prognostic index and a diagnostic tool.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Methylation of lysines on histones, controlled by various methyltransferases and demethylases, is an important component of epigenetic modifications, and abnormal regulation of such enzymes serves as common events in hepatocellular carcinoma. We determined to identify important methyltransferases and demethylases that might regulate the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by bioinformatics. Methods: The Oncomine and UALCAN databases were used to retrieve mRNA expression levels of histone lysine methyltransferases and demethylases in hepatocellular carcinoma. Data analyses of genetic alterations, mainly mutations and copy number alterations, were performed on the cBioportal platform. Protein-protein interactions were established in the STRING database. Results: mRNA expression of 8 genes correlated with clinical staging and grading, whereas 4 genes indicated a role in the prognosis, all co-expressed with SEDB1 and WHSC1. Genetically, 12 genes showing an alteration rate higher than 5% were identified, and only 3 were indicative of prognosis. Copy number gains in ASH1L, SETDB1, and KDM5B might partially contribute to the upregulation of their mRNA expression. The close relationship of mutations in MLL2/MLL3 with driver gene mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma provided a rationale for further investigation. Conclusions: We identified 11 methyltransferases and demethylases for major histone lysines that might be promising research targets in the pathogenesis, development, and prediction of prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma using bioinformatics.",

    "Abstract": "Crude linoleic acid incorporated with or without butter yellow in a synthetic diet proved to be toxic for rats. The toxic effect manifested itself in loss of weight, progressive anemia of the secondary type, leucopenia, and pediculosis. It could be neutralized preventively and therapeutically by administration of yeast. The toxicity of the diet containing linoleic acid appears to be due to oxidative break-down products of the unsaturated fatty acid. The color of the same diet when it contained crude linoleic acid supplemented with butter yellow faded progressively in the presence of air (O(2)), even at room temperature. Purified preparations of linoleic acid and, to a less degree, purified preparations of arachidonic and oleic acids have shown the same destructive effect on butter yellow in vitro. Brown (unpolished) or white rice contains a stabilizer (antioxidant) for the preservation of butter yellow. In experiments on the production of hepatoma in rats following the ingestion of butter yellow, rice on one hand and crisco or butter fat on the other hand have proved to be procarcinogenic. These results would seem to be correlated with the preservation of butter yellow in the diet and in the intestine, because of the antioxidant in rice and the low supply of unsaturated fatty acids,respectively.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A is functionally inactivated, through mutations, deletions, or methylation, in a large variety of primary neoplasms as well as tumor cell lines. The CDKN2A locus gives rise to two distinct transcripts. P16INK4 and P19ARF. Because it has been shown that the disruption of only P19arf-coding sequences in mice is sufficient for tumor development, this transcript most likely also encodes a tumor suppressor. We have analyzed the two CDKN2A transcripts in fifteen human primary liver carcinomas, two human hepatoma cell lines, and five rodent hepatoma cell lines. No homozygous deletions of P19ARF and P16INK4 were found in these samples, whereas the normal P19arf transcript was absent in two of the five rodent cell lines (nonexpressed in one case and mutated in another). These results suggest that functional abrogation of P19ARF is not a primary event in hepatocarcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Human hepatocellular carcinomas from patients in Britain, an area of low prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma and low dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1, were analyzed for mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. Abnormalities in the p53 gene were detected in 2 of 19 hepatocellular carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction--single-stranded conformation polymorphism. Direct sequencing of the evolutionarily conserved regions of p53 (exons 5, 6, 7 and 8), where mutations have been commonly found in a variety of tumors, confirmed that only two hepatocellular carcinomas had mutations in p53, one a 6-bp deletion of codons 158 and 159 (exon 5) and the other a G to A transition at codon 286 (exon 8). No mutations were found in any hepatocellular carcinoma in exons 6 and 7; in particular all tumors had wild-type sequence at codon 249, which has been reported to be a mutational hot spot in the p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinomas from high incidence areas such as China and southern Africa. Abnormalities in p53 expression were examined by immunohistochemistry and found in 1 of the 19 hepatocellular carcinomas. These findings show that p53 mutations are infrequently involved in the malignant transformation of hepatocytes in an area of low hepatocellular carcinoma prevalence. They support the suggestion of a possible link between dietary exposure to aflatoxin and selective G to T mutations at codon 249 of the p53 gene. Our observations also indicate that hepatitis B virus infection alone, present in six of the hepatocellular carcinomas examined, does not account for the specificity for codon 249 mutations reported from endemic areas.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene have been recently described in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from high risk areas such as China and South Africa. Our study was designed to assess the importance of p53 aberrations in HCCs from Europe, where the major risk factors in hepatocarcinogenesis, aflatoxin exposure and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, do not play a dominant role. We investigated 22 HCCs and, as controls, their corresponding tumour-free liver tissues, seven livers with primary biliary cirrhosis and four morphologically normal livers. p53 overexpression, which is usually associated with point mutations of the p53 gene, was detected in 10 of the 22 HCCs by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. p53 expression was restricted to the nucleus in the positive cells, while all cells in the control tissues were negative. There was no obvious etiological preference in the p53 positive tumours. Particularly, underlying chronic HBV infection did not appear to be associated with an increased rate of p53 overexpression in European HCCs. SSCP and sequence analysis of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene revealed point mutations in six out of eight tumours with increased steady state levels of p53. In conclusion, our study demonstrates increased p53 levels due to point mutations in a significant proportion of European HCCs. The codon 249 mutation, which was detected in one of the cases, is not predominant in these tumours.",

    "Abstract": "Abnormalities of the tumor-suppressor p53 gene have been discovered in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear, however, whether HCC related to chronic viral hepatitis is associated with p53 gene alterations. In this study, we have examined p53 abnormalities in HCC associated with hepatitis C and B virus (HCV and HBV) infections. Tissues from 18 HCC patients from several hospitals throughout the United States were collected (9 were HCV-infected, 5 were HBV-infected, 1 was HCV/HBV-infected, and 3 were non-virus-associated). Immunostaining with monoclonal pAb 1801 revealed expression of p53 protein in tumor-cell nuclei in one HCV-associated HCC, and in no case of HBV-associated HCC, while the nuclei of adjacent hepatocytes were negative. Using Hae III-digestion of chromosomal DNA, mutations at codon 249 were not found in any of 18 HCC tissues studied. Direct sequencing demonstrated a mutated codon 244 and a wild-type codon 249 in the conserved regions (exon 5-8) of p53 gene from the tumor tissue with nuclear p53 expression. By reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the expression of p53 mRNA was demonstrated in tumor cells from 10 out of 16 HCC tissues. In conclusion, the specific mutation at codon 249 with G to T transversion was not observed in the HCCs associated with HCV or HBV infections. In HBV or non-virus-associated HCCs studied, no other p53 gene abnormalities were found. A point mutation at codon 244 with G to A transition of p53 gene was detected in only one of 10 HCV-associated HCCs, which suggests that p53 mutations may not play a significant role in HCV- or HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate the association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study by using claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The study cohort comprised 1380 newly diagnosed HBV-infected patients with SSRI use who were frequency matched by age, sex, liver cirrhosis, and index year with HBV-infected patients without SSRI use in the comparison cohort. Each patient case was followed from 2000 to 2012 to identify incident HCC cases. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to evaluate the association between SSRI use and HCC risk. The further sensitivity analysis used case-control study design. A total of 9070 HCC subjects retrieved from NHIRD, and equal non-HCC subjects were analyzed after matching for age and sex. Results: We identified 9 and 24 HCC cases in the study and comparison cohorts during the follow-up period of 7056 and 6845 person-years, respectively. The incidence rate of HCC was 1.28 and 3.51 per 1000 person-years for SSRI and non-SSRI users, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for SSRI use was 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.64; p = 0.0027). For SSRI users with a cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) of 28-89, 90-364, and ≥365, the adjusted HRs were 0.51, 0.22, and 0.12, respectively, (95% CI, 0.21-1.25, 0.05-0.94, and 0.02-0.90, respectively) compared with non-SSRI users (<28 cDDD). The sensitivity analysis showed that the SSRI presented with a dose-response protective effect for HCC in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion: SSRIs use may possibly reduce the risk of HCC in HBV-infected patients in a dose-responsive manner.",

This study analyzed a hepatocellular adenoma of a 2-year-old child at risk for familial adenomatous polyposis to identify genetic alterations in hepatic tumors initiated by APC germline mutations. Methods: Mutation screening was performed for the APC gene (protein truncation test and DNA sequence analysis), p53 gene (complementary DNA cloning and sequencing), and members of the Ras gene family (complementary DNA sequence analysis). Results: Both the mother and child had a germinal CGA-->TGA transition at codon 1451 leading to an Arg1451Ter stop mutation in the APC gene. Loss of the wild-type APC allele as a second hit revealed hemizygosity of the inherited mutation in the tumor. Furthermore, a CGC-->CAC transition in the p53 gene of the adenoma resulted in an Arg-->His missense mutation in codon 175. No loss of heterozygosity was detected at the p53 locus. Ras gene mutations were not found. Conclusions: Biallelic inactivation of APC gene and p53 mutation are early events in hepatocellular tumorigenesis. Additional reports will confirm whether inherited APC gene mutations between codon 1444 and 1578 increase the risk for hepatic tumors.",

Ascites, pleural effusion, and bile leakage occurred in 2, 1, and 1 patients, respectively. No patients expired as a result of the surgery or liver failure. The mean hospital stay was 7 (4-15) days. All patients had R0 resection. After a mean follow-up of 22 (8-33) months, no patients experienced recurrence of disease.

Patients and methods: A total of 221 patients with hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients who received curative liver resection were included. After propensity matching analysis, 188 patients were enrolled in the final analysis. COX regression analyses were used to analyze the prognosis value of AAPR and other prognostic factors. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) curves were constructed and compared between different groups. Results: The optimal cutoff of AAPR was defined as 0.40 with X-tile software. According to cutoff value, patients were divided into low-AAPR group (≤0.40) and high-AAPR group (>0.40). The cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 97.1%, 78.2%, and 67.3% in patients with AAPR>0.40 group, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the AAPR≤0.40 group (80.2%, 54.4%, and 40.1%, respectively) (P <0.001). In the multivariate COX regression analysis, AAPR, tumor number, ascites, and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) were independent risk factors for OS and RFS. Conclusion: AAPR shows promise as a reliable prognostic factor in patients with hepatitis B virus-related HCC after curative hepatectomy, which could be used as a routine inspection of HCC patients before surgery.",

    "Abstract": "Epigenetic alterations and microRNA (miRNA) deregulation are common in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) tri-methylating enzyme, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) mediates epigenetic silencing of gene expression and is frequently up-regulated in human cancers. In this study we aimed to delineate the implications of EZH2 up-regulation in miRNA deregulation and HCC metastasis. Expressions of a total of 90 epigenetic regulators were first determined in 38 pairs of primary HCCs and their corresponding nontumorous livers. We identified EZH2 and its associated polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) as one of the most significantly deregulated epigenetic regulators in primary HCC samples. Up-regulation of EZH2 was next confirmed in 69.5% (41/59) of primary HCCs. Clinicopathologically, EZH2 up-regulation was associated with HCC progression and multiple HCC metastatic features, including venous invasion (P = 0.043), direct liver invasion (P = 0.014), and absence of tumor encapsulation (P = 0.043). We further demonstrated that knockdown of EZH2 in HCC cell lines reduced the global levels of tri-methylated H3K27, and suppressed HCC motility in vitro and pulmonary metastasis in a nude mouse model. By interrogating the miRNA expression profile in EZH2-knockdown cell lines and primary HCC samples, we identified a subset of miRNA that was epigenetically suppressed by EZH2 in human HCC. These included well-characterized tumor-suppressor miRNAs, such as miR-139-5p, miR-125b, miR-101, let-7c, and miR-200b. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed a common regulatory role of these EZH2-silenced miRNAs in modulating cell motility and metastasis-related pathways. Our findings suggest that EZH2 exerts its prometastatic function by way of epigenetic silencing of multiple tumor suppressor miRNAs. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that EZH2 epigenetically silenced multiple miRNAs that negatively regulate HCC metastasis.",

    "Abstract": "To analyse the effect of p53 on liver tumor development, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type p53 in the liver and crossed them with transgenic mice in which the expression of the SV40 large T antigen (TAg) induces hepatic tumors. Remarkably, whereas preneoplastic TAg liver exhibited anisocaryosis and anisocytosis, TAg/p53 liver never presented any dysplastic cells. Moreover, whereas expression of p53 did not affect hepatic development, its constitutive expression in tumorigenic livers resulted in a significantly enhanced apoptosis once nodules had appeared. In contrast, p53 overexpression did not modify the elevated proliferation of TAg-transformed hepatocytes and had no effect on hepatocarcinoma progression. In vitro analysis of primary hepatocytes exposed to various genotoxic agents showed that p53 failed to sensitize normal or TAg-transformed hepatocytes to apoptosis, except when high doses of doxorubicin, UV-B and UV-C radiation were used. Our results confirmed that the hepatocyte cell type is very resistant to genotoxic agents and showed that constitutive expression of p53 failed to improve their responsiveness. In addition, our results showed that suppression of dysplastic cells, probably by restoring normal cytokinesis and karyokinesis, and enhancement of apoptosis by means of p53 overexpression were insufficient to counteract or delay the TAg-induced liver tumoral progression.

    "Abstract": "Objective: To assess the technical feasibility and local efficacy of biplane fluoroscopy plus US-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for viable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) around retained iodized oil after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Materials and methods: Our prospective study was approved by our institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all participating patients. For patients with viable HCC around retained iodized oil after TACE, biplane fluoroscopy plus US-guided RFA was performed. We evaluated the rate of technical success and major complications on a post-RFA CT examination and local tumor progression with a follow-up CT. Results: Among 40 consecutive patients, 19 were excluded due to one of the following reasons: poorly visible HCC on fluoroscopy (n = 13), high risk location (n = 2), RFA performed under monoplane fluoroscopy and US guidance (n = 2), and poorly identifiable new HCCs on US (n = 2). The remaining 21 patients with 21 viable HCCs were included. The size of total tumors ranged from 1.4 to 5.0 cm (mean: 3.2 cm) in the longest diameter. Technical success was achieved for all 21 HCCs, and major complications were observed in none of the patients. During the follow-up period (mean, 20.3 months; range, 6.5-29.9 months), local tumor progression was found in two patients (2/21, 9.5%). Distant intrahepatic metastasis developed in 76.2% (16/21) of patients. Conclusion: When retained iodized oil around the tumor after TACE hampers the targeting of the viable tumor for RFA, biplane fluoroscopy plus US-guided RFA may be performed owing to its technical feasibility and effective treatment for viable HCCs.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/aims: The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of the development of large amounts of ascites (LA) after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The medical records of 137 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC from January 2010 to December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: LA group, with ascites drainage >500 cc per day over 3 days (n=37) and control group (n=100). Preoperative and intraoperative clinical variables were compared between the two groups. Results: Thirty-seven (27.0%) patients developed LA. Platelet counts of <100,000/mm3, ICG-R15 >10%, CTP scores of 6 or 7 points, major resection, the presence of cirrhosis, preoperative ascites, and portal hypertension were significantly more frequent in LA group. Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher CTP score (HR=4.1), the presence of portal hypertension (HR=26.7), and major resection (HR=18.5) were independent and significant risk factors of postoperative ascites development. Persistent refractory ascites developed in 6 (16.2%) patients who succumbed to hepatic failure during follow-up. Conclusions: Patients with a 6 or 7 point CTP score, major hepatic resection and/or portal hypertension were more likely to develop LA and experience deterioration of liver function after surgery. The selection of patients for hepatic resection should be based on a balanced assessment of the benefits of HCC treatment and risk of postoperative liver failure.",

    "Abstract": "Although alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used tumor marker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 40% of newly diagnosed patients do not have an elevated AFP level. Research has revealed that mutations in the HNF1A binding site of the AFP gene promoter cause significantly elevated serum AFP levels in patients with hereditary persistence of AFP. This study investigated the relationship between HNF1A genetic variants and serum AFP levels. We examined the association between the HNF1A-rs1169288 (A/C), rs2464196 (G/A), and rs1169310 (C/T) polymorphisms and AFP levels in a healthy Chinese population (n = 1010) and HCC patients (n = 185). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by the amplification refractory mutation system combined with TaqMan probe in real-time PCR. The serum AFP concentrations were measured using the Architect i2000 immunochemistry analyzer. In healthy individuals, serum AFP levels were significantly lower with the rs2464196-AA and rs1169310-TT genotypes. Similar significant differences were observed in HCC patients. Moreover, in HCC patients, the distribution frequencies of rs2464196-AA+AG and rs1169310-TT+TC among those with AFP ≤ 20 ng/ml or ≤400 ng/ml were significantly lower than those in patients with AFP > 20 ng/ml or >400 ng/ml. Among all subjects, those carrying the HNF1A-rs2464196-A or rs1169310-T allele tended to have low levels of AFP. However, the HNF1A-rs1169288 polymorphism showed no significant association with the serum AFP level. These findings provide new insight into the genetic determinants of serum AFP level and can aid the differential diagnosis of HCC patients with low serum AFP.",

    "Abstract": "Mutant p53 could have either a dominant negative effect or a gain of function to interfere with p53's ability to maintain genomic stability. In the present study, we screened for TP53 mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from 202 Chinese patients, followed by analysis of transcriptional and apoptotic activities of 21 p53 mutants with or without wild-type p53 present. We identified a new point mutation p.P72A, and a mutation (p.E294SfsX51) with a record long frameshift. We found TP53 mutations in HCC bear mutants without a dominant wild-type p53 inhibition on p21 transcription at a higher frequency. We found an anti-correlation for p53 WT/mutant heterotetramer to activate p21 and BAX transcription, i.e., at given p53 WT/mutant concentration, the fold increase p21 transcription is proportional to the fold of decreasing BAX transcription. Our kinetic model reproduced the trend in the experimental observation and confirmed that the p53 WT-dimer/mutant- heterotetramer is the major species to confer the differential activation of p21 and BAX transcription. p53 may have different binding modes on p21 and BAX, most likely resulting from the combinational effects of core domain binding and C-terminal mediation. Our study demonstrated that p53 mutants interfere with the ability of WT p53 to maintain genomic stability.",

    "Abstract": "The tumour suppressor protein p53 mediates cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis after activation by multiple forms of cellular stresses. When activated, this \"master protein\" modulates its response depending on the type and intensity of the stress. The TP53 gene with its nearly 20,000 described mutations is the most mutated gene in cancer. Most mutations are missense and occur at over 200 codons within the central portion of the gene. In several cancers, the distribution of mutation types and sites follow a specific pattern reflecting the effects of environmental mutagens. An example for such a \"mutagen fingerprint\" is TP53 mutation at codon 249 in hepatocellular carcinoma in regions of the world characterised by high levels of the mutagen aflatoxin B1 and endemic HBV infection. Recently, TP53 mutations have been detected in surrogate sources of genetic material such as free circulating DNA isolated from plasma. Plasma TP53 mutations can be detected in the blood of pre-cancer and cancer patients, with potential application for early cancer detection. Thus, TP53 mutations have multiple applications as markers of mutagenic exposures, or as intermediate end-points in assessment of cancer occurrence and progression.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To develop and validate a nomogram for predicting the overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy who underwent microwave ablation (MWA). Methods: The training cohort included 299 patients with recurrent HCCs after hepatectomy who met the Milan criteria and received MWA from April 2007 to December 2017. Baseline characteristics were collected to identify risk factors for the determination of death after MWA. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model based on significant risk factors was used to develop the nomogram, which was then assessed for its predictive accuracy using Harrell's C-index and the area under the curve (AUC). The nomogram was validated by internal (n = 240) and external cohorts (n = 205) from another hospital. Results: After a median follow-up of 32.3 months, 38.8% (116/299) of patients had died. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that comorbid disease, early recurrence, and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grades 2-3 were independent prognostic factors for poor OS. This nomogram accurately stratified patients into subgroups with low or high risk. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates in the low-risk subgroup were 99.4%, 97.2%, and 86.1%, respectively, and they were 92.8%, 70.3%, and 45.8% in the high-risk subgroup (P < 0.001). The nomogram predicted OS in the training cohort with a C-index score of 0.801 (95% CI 0.761-0.841). The nomogram was validated by internal and external cohorts, with C-index scores of 0.792 (95% CI 0.738-0.846) and 0.744 (95% CI 0.703-0.785), respectively. Conclusion: The nomogram provides individualized risk estimates for long-term OS for patients with recurrent HCC after hepatectomy who underwent MWA.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the recurrence rate of HCC after LT and prognostic factors for recurrence by comparing LT with non-transplanted resection. Methods: The participants were 338 patients who underwent LT between 1996 and 2012 at Seoul National University Hospital (LT group) and 520 HCC patients who underwent partial hepatectomy between 1995 and 2006 (control group, non-LT group). Results: In the LT group, 68 of 338 patients (19.8%) showed relapse, and the recurrence rate was lower than that in the non-LT group (64.9%, 357/520, p < .001). Stratification analysis by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage showed that the stage I-II LT group had a lower recurrence rate than the non-LT group. Univariate comparative analysis demonstrated that multiplicity of tumor, tumor size, gross type, Edmondson- Steiner (ES) nuclear grade, extent of tumor, angioinvasion, AJCC stage, Milan criteria, University of California at San Francisco criteria on explant pathology (all p < .001), positive expression of cytokeratin 19 (p = .002), and preoperative α-fetoprotein (AFP) (p < .001) were predictors of tumor recurrence. In multivariate analysis, LT, preoperative AFP, multiplicity of tumor, extent of tumor, size of tumor, and ES nuclear grade were independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: LT might have a protective effect against the late recurrence of stage I-II HCC compared to non-LT, and the prognostic factors for recurrence were similar to previously well-known prognostic factors for HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: It is not fully clear whether the effect of short-term management in community can reduce the long-term risk of stroke OBJECTIVES:: To evaluate whether short-term hypertension management is associated with long-term incidence of stroke and total death in community health centers in China. Design: Community controlled trail. Participants: Six community health centers (4 active, 2 control) in China, patients with hypertension. Control arm: Patients were treated with normally therapy method. Active arm: Patients were treated oriented by the Guideline for hypertension management. Randomization: Two centers (Hebei and Zhejiang) from the Hypertension Control in Community (HCC) Project, which was conducted from 2005 to 2008, were randomly selected for this study. Four thousand hypertensive patients from these centers, who were under management for one year in the baseline, were followed up in 2013. The electronic health record system (2005-2008) was used to identify 2000 hypertensive patients, who were not included in HCC but lived in comparable community health center in the same province, as the control group. All baseline and follow-up data were collected using standardized questionnaires for stroke outcomes. Main outcome measures: Stroke. Results: Of the 6000 participants, 3787 (63.1%) were eligible for analysis. At the time of follow-up, the average BP was kept in the lower level than that in baseline, and the control rate was 59.3%. After propensity-score matching, 110 strokes (2.0% vs 4.6%) and 141 deaths (1.4% vs 3.8%) were noted in the matched intervention and control groups (1078 pairs), respectively. Patients in the intervention group were less likely to experience a stroke or die than those in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-0.62, P < 0.01; HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.35-0.72, P < 0.01). The sensitivity analysis showed similar results. Conclusions: Short-term management of hypertension had a positive effect on the long-term risk reduction of death and stroke in hypertensive patients.",

    "Abstract": "alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is produced abundantly in fetal liver but is hardly detectable in adults. In this study, we investigated two unrelated Japanese families with hereditary persistence of AFP. A g-->a substitution at nucleotide -119 (-119g-->a) in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 binding site of the AFP promoter was identified in both families. The activity of the wild- or variant-type human AFP promoter was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo transfection experiments. This substitution in the AFP promoter significantly stimulated its transcriptional activity in human hepatoma cells, regardless of their prior AFP production. The variant-type AFP promoter was also active in adult mouse livers in vivo. Additionally, overexpression of HNF-1alpha stimulated the activity of both the wild- and variant-type AFP promoters in hepatoma cells. HNF-1alpha expression also activated both AFP promoters even in nonhepatoma cells, and this activation was suppressed by nuclear factor (NF)-I overexpression. These results indicate that an HNF-1 binding site mutation leads to induction of the AFP gene expression in adult liver, and suggest that competition between HNF-1 and NF-I in this region is involved in transcriptional regulation of the AFP gene during hepatic development.",

Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between serum adipocytokines and the histologic findings of the liver in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Patients and methods: This case-control study was performed on those with persistent elevated liver enzymes and with evidence of fatty liver in ultrasonography. After exclusion of patients with other etiologies causing abnormal liver function tests, the resulting patients underwent liver biopsies. NAFLD was diagnosed based on liver histology according to the Brunt scoring system. Results: Waist circumferences and levels of blood glucose (after fasting), insulin, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferases (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferases (AST) were higher in patients with NAFLD than in those in the control group. ALT, AST, and gamma glutamine transferase (GGT) levels were lower in patients with liver steatosis of a grade of less than 33% than those with higher degrees of steatosis. Serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, and hepcidin levels were significantly higher in those with lobular inflammation of grade 0 - 1 than in those with inflammation of grade 2 - 3 (Brunt score). Meanwhile, AST was significantly lower in those with lobular inflammation of grade 1 than in those with grade 2-3. Hepcidin and resistin levels were significantly higher in patients with moderate to severe fibrosis than in those with mild fibrosis.

Materials and methods: The expression of TGF-β1 and FGFR4 in 126 HCC samples was detected immunohistochemically. Combined with clinical postoperative follow-up data, the expression of TGF-β1 and FGFR4 in HCC and the relationship with the prognosis of patients were analyzed by statistically. Results: The positive expression rate of TGF-β1 was 84.1% (106/126) in tumors, and that in peritumoral liver tissues was 64.3% (81/126); the positive expression rate of FGFR4 in tumors was 74.6% (94/126) and that in peritumoral liver tissues was 57.1% (72/126). The expression of TGF-β1 and FGFR4 in the carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in peritumoral liver tissues (p < 0.05). Intratumoral TGF-β1 and FGFR4 expression was associated with TNM stage (p < 0.05). TGF-β1 and FGFR4 expression levels didn't significantly correlate with other clinicopathological parameters, including age, sex, tumor size, serum AFP level, tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, etc. (p > 0.05). TGF-β1 expression was positively correlated with FGFR4 expression (r = 0.595, p < 0.05). Patients with positive FGFR4 or TGF-β1 expression had shorter overall survival compared with negative expression (p < 0.05).

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: This study aimed to clarify the effect of obesity on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving antiviral treatment. Methods: This study applied a retrospective analysis to a historical cohort in Bundang Jesaeng Hospital. In total, 102 CHB patients were treated with entecavir as an initial treatment for CHB and checked for obesity using a body composition analyzer. Hepatic steatosis was measured semiquantitatively using Hamaguchi's scoring system in ultrasonography. Risk factors for the development of HCC were analyzed, including obesity-related factors (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference [WC], waist-to-hip ratio [WHR], visceral fat area [VFA], and hepatic steatosis). Results: The median follow-up duration of the patients was 45.2 months (interquartile range: 36.0-58.3 months). The cumulative incidence rates of HCC at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years were 0%, 5.3%, and 9.0%, respectively. Univariable analysis revealed that the risk factors for HCC development were a platelet count of <120,000 /mm2 (hazard ratio [HR]=5.21, P=0.031), HBeAg negativity (HR=5.61, P=0.039), and liver cirrhosis (HR=10.26, P=0.031). Multivariable analysis showed that the significant risk factor for HCC development was liver cirrhosis (HR=9.07, P=0.042). However, none of the obesity-related risk factors were significantly associated with HCC: BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (HR=0.90, P=0.894), WC ≥90 cm (HR=1.10, P=0.912), WHR ≥0.9 (HR=1.94, P=0.386), VFA ≥100 cm2 (HR=1.69, P=0.495), and hepatic steatosis (HR=0.57, P=0.602). Conclusion: HCC development is associated with liver cirrhosis but not obesity-related factors in CHB patients receiving entecavir.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: We investigated factors associated with the disease progression and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients during long-term oral nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy. Methods: This retrospective study included 524 naive CHB patients who received oral NA therapy for more than 48 weeks between January 2003 and December 2007. The primary outcome was 5-year cumulative probability of disease progression and HCC development. Disease progression was defined as cirrhosis development, cirrhotic complications, HCC or liver-related mortality. Results: For the 524 patients, the cumulative probabilities of disease progression and HCC development at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years were 1.1%, 6.3%, 9.0%, 11.6%, and 16.2% and 0.2%, 1.8%, 3.6%, 5.8%, and 9.3%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age >50 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05) and cirrhosis (HR, 2.95) were significant factors for disease progression. Similarly, age >50 years (HR, 1.05), family history of HCC (HR, 5.48), and cirrhosis (HR, 17.16) were significant factors for HCC development. Importantly, longer duration (>12 months) of maintained virological response (<20 IU/mL) reduced the risks of disease progression (HR, 0.19) and HCC development (HR, 0.09). Conclusions: Longer duration of maintained virological response significantly reduces the risk of disease progression or HCC development in CHB patients undergoing long-term oral NA therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Improved prognostic prediction is needed to stratify patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (EHCC) to refine selection of adjuvant therapy. We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML)-based model to predict survival after liver resection for EHCC based on readily available clinical data. Methods: We analyzed data of surgically resected EHCC (tumor≤5 cm without evidence of extrahepatic disease or major vascular invasion) patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program to train and internally validate a gradient-boosting ML model to predict disease-specific survival (DSS). We externally tested the ML model using data from 2 Chinese institutions. Patients treated with resection were matched by propensity score to those treated with transplantation in the SEER-Medicare database. Results: A total of 2778 EHCC patients treated with resection were enrolled, divided into 1899 for training/validation (SEER) and 879 for test (Chinese). The ML model consisted of 8 covariates (age, race, alpha-fetoprotein, tumor size, multifocality, vascular invasion, histological grade and fibrosis score) and predicted DSS with C-Statistics >0.72, better than proposed staging systems across study cohorts. The ML model could stratify 10-year DSS ranging from 70% in low-risk subset to 5% in high-risk subset. Compared with low-risk subset, no remarkable survival benefits were observed in EHCC patients receiving transplantation before and after propensity score matching. Conclusion: An ML model trained on a large-scale dataset has good predictive performance at individual scale. Such a model is readily integrated into clinical practice and will be valuable in discussing treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: We performed a national survey to update hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) epidemiology in Brazil and determined the clinical and epidemiological profiles of patients with HCC in different Brazilian regions. Methods: Data from 29 centers included 1,405 patients diagnosed with HCC from 2004 to 2009. Results: The median age was 59 (1-92 years old; 78% male). At diagnosis, females were older than males (median age: 62 vs. 59 years old respectively; p<0.0001). Ninety-eight percent of the patients had cirrhosis (1279/1308). Hepatitis C virus was the main etiology (54%), followed by hepatitis B virus (16%) and alcohol (14%). In Southeastern and Southern Brazil, hepatitis C virus accounted for over 55% of cases. In the Northeast and North, hepatitis C virus accounted for less than 50%, and hepatitis B virus accounted for 22-25% of cases; hepatitis B was more prevalent in the Northern than in the Southern regions. Some 43%, 35%, and 22% of patients were in early, intermediate, and advanced stages respectively. Initial therapies for HCC included chemoembolization or embolization (36%), percutaneous ablation (13%), liver resection (7%), and sorafenib (1%). Liver transplantation was performed in 242 patients (19%), but it was the initial therapy for only 56 patients (4%). Conclusion: The epidemiology, classification, and therapy selection for HCC varied among Brazilian regions. Hepatitis C infection was the most common etiology of liver cirrhosis; chemoembolization was the most common therapy employed. Liver cirrhosis was the main risk factor for HCC development in Brazil.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To understand the cellular and molecular changes in peripheral blood that can lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and provide new methods for its diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of HCC patients and normal controls and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)+ regulatory cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood was measured, and the expression of TGF-β was also determined. Then, the relationship between the changes and the 5-year survival of patients was analyzed. In addition, recombinant human TGF-β (rhTGF-β) and recombinant human interleukin-6 were added to stimulate the cultured cells, and their effects on HCC were evaluated. Results: The expression of TGF-β and the percentage of TGF-β+ Tregs in the peripheral blood of HCC patients increased significantly compared with normal controls. Compared with the low TGF-β expression group, the high TGF-β expression group had a significantly lower 5-year survival rate, and the same result was found in the two TGF-β+ Treg groups, suggesting that TGF-β and TGF-β+ Tregs were negatively correlated with the overall survival of the patients. In addition, rhTGF-β promoted the growth of tumor cells and induced high expression levels of IL-6, which further promoted tumor proliferation. Conclusion: The results showed that TGF-β may promote tumor growth and proliferation by inducing the production of IL-6, and TGF-β and TGF-β+ Tregs may serve as new markers for predicting a poor prognosis in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: The treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is removal of the virus in order to prevent progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Few data have been presented regarding the clinical significance of changes in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level in this context. We analyzed the patterns of changes in ALT level and investigated the relationship between the rapid normalization of ALT and sustained virologic response (SVR) after combined treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin. Methods: CHC patients (n=370) were classified into four groups according to the initial ALT level and subsequent changes: (1) initially abnormal ALT level and sustained abnormal ALT level during treatment, (2) initially abnormal ALT level but achievement of ALT normalization, (3) initially normal ALT level and variable ALT abnormality during treatment, and (4) initially normal ALT level and sustained normalization of ALT level during treatment. We subdivided groups 1 and 2 into those with patterns of decreased and normalization of ALT, with or without rapid normalization. We checked the end-treatment response (ETR) and SVR rates in each group and the factors associated with SVR, including patterns of changes in ALT level. Results: A total of 168 patients completed the therapy (age=54.34±10.64 years [mean±SD], 95 males [56.5%], genotype 1:82 [48.8%]). SVR was achieved in 115 (68.45%) of the completely treated patients. The SVR rate was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (37.8 vs. 81.6%, P<0.001), and significantly higher in the rapid normalization group than in the group without rapid normalization (78.5% vs. 41.2%, P<0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that age (odds ratio [OR]=0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.91-0.98, P=0.005), viral genotype (OR=2.76, 95% CI=1.20-6.38, P=0.017), and initial hepatitis C virus RNA titer (OR=0.28, 95% CI=0.10-0.75, P=0.012) were identified as independent significant predictive factors for SVR. Conclusions: The SVR rate is significantly associated with normalization, and especially rapid normalization of ALT. Rapid normalization of ALT by 4 weeks after treatment might be a useful response factor that is readily available in clinical practice, and especially for genotype 1 patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aim: The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with transfusion dependent thalassemia (TDT) has been increasing, where viral hepatitis and iron overload are the two established HCC risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the etiological factors of HCC development and to evaluate the possible factors associated with survival in our cohort of TDT patients with HCC. Methods: Records of patients with TDT diagnosed with HCC from 2008 to 2018 were reviewed. Liver iron concentration (LIC) has been assessed by the signal-intensity-ratio MRI. The diagnosis of HCC was made by a 3-phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and patients were staged and treated for HCC according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) grading system. Results: Forty-two TDT patients with HCC have been included. Most of them (78.5%) were anti-HCV positive, 59.5% HCV-RNA positive, and 16.5% had serological markers of resolved HBV infection. Patients with HCV infection have been treated successfully with either Peg-IFNa±Ribavirin or with the new direct antivirals (DAAs). At the time of HCC diagnosis, all patients with chronic HCV infection were HCV-RNA negative, 78.5% had underlying cirrhosis, and the vast majority (98%) had average or mild elevated LIC values. According to the BCLC system, patients were classified as 0-A: 28.5%, B: 57% and C-D: 14.5%. HCC has been treated with loco-regional treatment in 78.5% of our patients, while the rest have received sorafenib. Twenty-eight patients (66.5%) died due to HCC with a median survival time of 6 months (range: 2-60). Using the Cox proportional hazard model, the only factors associated with poor survival were BCLC stages C and D. Conclusions: In conclusion, BCLC staging is the main prognostic factor of survival in patients with TDT who develop HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Loss of function of the p53 protein, which may occur through a range of molecular events, is critical in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) evolution. MDM2, an oncogene, acts as a major regulator of the p53 protein. A polymorphism in the MDM2 promoter, SNP309 (T/G), has been shown to alter protein expression and may thus play a role in carcinogenesis. MDM2 SNP309 is also associated with HCC. However, the role of SNP309 in hepatocarcinogenesis with respect to TP53 mutations is unknown. In this study, we investigated the distribution of the MDM2 SNP309 genotype and somatic TP53 (the p53 tumor suppressor gene) mutations in 99 human HCC samples from Africa, Europe, China and Japan. Samples exhibited striking geographical differences in their distribution of SNP309 genotypes. The frequency and spectrum of p53 mutations also varied geographically; TP53 mutations were frequent in Africa, where the SNP309 T/T genotype predominated but were rare in Europe and Japan, where the SNP309 G allele was present more frequently. TP53 mutations were detected in 18% (4/22) of SNP309 T/G and G/G and 82% (18/22) of SNP309 T/T genotype holders; this difference was statistically highly significant (P-value=0.0006). Our results indicated that the presence of the SNP309 G allele is inversely associated with the presence of somatic TP53 mutations because they only coincided in 4% of HCC cases. This finding suggests that the SNP309 G allele may functionally replace p53 mutations, and in addition to known etiological factors, may be partly responsible for differential HCC prevalence.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The association between TP53 R72P and/or MDM2 SNP309 polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk has been widely reported, but results were inconsistent. To clarify the effects of these polymorphisms on HCC risk, an updated meta-analysis of all available studies was conducted. Methods: Eligible articles were identified by search of databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM) for the period up to July 2013. Data were extracted by two independent authors and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Metaregression and subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Results: Finally, a total of 10 studies including 2,243 cases and 3,615 controls were available for MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism and 14 studies containing 4,855 cases and 6,630 controls were included for TP53 R72P polymorphism. With respect to MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism, significantly increased HCC risk was found in the overall population. In subgroup analysis by ethnicity and hepatitis virus infection status, significantly increased HCC risk was found in Asians, Caucasians, Africans, and HCV positive patients. With respect to TP53 R72P polymorphism, no significant association with HCC risk was observed in the overall and subgroup analyses. In the MDM2 SNP309-TP53 R72P interaction analysis, we found that subjects with MDM2 309TT and TP53 Pro/Pro genotype, MDM2 309 TG and TP53 Arg/Pro genotype, and MDM2 309 GG and TP53 Pro/Pro genotype were associated with significantly increased risk of developing HCC as compared with the reference MDM2 309TT and TP53 Arg/Arg genotype. Conclusions: We concluded that MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism may play an important role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. In addition, our findings further suggest that the combination of MDM2 SNP 309 and TP53 Arg72Pro genotypes confers higher risk to develop HCC. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms within TP53 gene (codon 72 exon 4, rs1042522, encoding either arginine or proline) and MDM2 promoter (SNP309; rs2279744), have been independently associated with increased risk of several cancer types. Few studies have analysed the role of these polymorphisms in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Genotype distribution of TP53 codon 72 and MDM2 SNP309 in 61 viral hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 122 blood samples (healthy controls) from Italian subjects were determined by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Results: Frequencies of TP53 codon 72 alleles were not significantly different between cases and controls. A significant increase of MDM2 SNP309 G/G and T/G genotypes were observed among hepatocellular carcinoma cases (Odds Ratio, OR = 3.56, 95% Confidence Limits, 95% CI = 1.3-9.7; and OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.3-6.4, respectively).

    "Abstract": "In the past 20 years there have been great advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics of gastrointestinal tumors. In general, cancers develop and proliferate due to: driver mutations or related alterations in the genome resulting in overactivity of oncogenes, underactivity of tumor suppressor genes allowing tumors to grow, and impaired DNA repair mechanisms either from sequential mutations with or without germline mutations predisposing patients to cancer. Infections such as hepatitis B and C, and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) can lead to hepatocellular cancers and anal cancers, respectively. This genomic knowledge has helped us better define unique subsets within diseases like colon and pancreatic cancer which may benefit from precisely targeted therapies. Alterations in key proteins on tumors and in the tumor microenvironment can be targets for molecular-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapies, immunotherapies and other targeted treatments. Molecular imaging may be deployed more aggressively in high-risk groups for possible detection of tumor occurrence, progression, and response to therapy. This chapter provides a brief summary of the genomics of gastrointestinal tumors, selected examples of targeted therapies, and examples of how current and emerging molecular imaging tools, assessing the tumor phenotype, inform our management of patients with tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib (TACE-S) combined with microwave ablation (TACE-S-MWA) for the treatment of patients with advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Between January 2015 and December 2018, 152 consecutive advanced HCC patients, who underwent TACE-S-MWA (MWA group, n=77) or TACE-S (Non-MWA group, n=75), were investigated. Overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP) and safety were compared between the two groups. Prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Results: Baseline patient characteristics were balanced between the two groups. MWA group was associated with a higher OS (median, 19.0 vs 13.0 months; P<0.001) and a longer TTP (median, 6.0 vs 3.0 months; P<0.001) compared with non-MWA group. Multivariate analyses showed that portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) (P=0.002), duration of sorafenib (P<0.001), and MWA treatment (P=0.011) were independently associated with OS. MWA treatment strategy (P<0.001) was a significant predictor of TTP. There were no treatment-related mortalities in either group. The rates of minor complications (42.9% vs 38.7%, P=0.599) and major complications (1.29% vs 1.33%, P=0.985) in the MWA group were similar to those in the non-MWA group. Conclusion: TACE-S-MWA was safe and effective for advanced primary HCC. TACE-S-MWA resulted in better OS and TTP than did TACE-S for treatment of patients with advanced primary HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To describe one case of bilateral Tapia's syndrome in a liver transplanted patient and to review the literature. Methods: We report a case of bilateral Tapia's syndrome in a 50-year-old man with a history of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus child. A liver cirrhosis and a bi-nodular hepatocellular carcinoma, who underwent liver transplantation after general anesthesia under orotracheal intubation. Uneventful extubation was performed in the intensive care unit during the following hours. On postoperative day (POD) 3, he required urgent re-laparotomy due to perihepatic hematoma complicated with respiratory gram negative bacilli infection. On POD 13, patient was extubated, but required immediate re-intubation due to severe respiratory failure. At the following day a third weaning failure occurred, requiring the performance of a percutaneous tracheostomy. Five days later, the patient was taken off mechanical ventilation and severe dysphagia, sialorrea and aphonia revealed. A computerized tomography and a magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck excluded central nervous injury. A stroboscopy showed bilateral paralysis of vocal cords and tongue and a diagnosis of bilateral Tapia's syndrome was performed. With conservative management, including a prompt establishment of a speech and swallowing rehabilitation program, the patient achieved full recovery within four months after liver transplantation. We carried out MEDLINE search for the term Tapia's syndrome. The inclusion criteria had no restriction by language or year but must provide sufficient available data to exclude duplicity. We described the clinical evolution of the patients, focusing on author, year of publication, age, sex, preceding problem, history of endotracheal intubation, unilateral or bilateral presentation, diagnostic procedures, type of treatment, follow-up, and outcome. Results: Several authors mentioned the existence of around 70 cases, however only 54 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We found only five published studies of bilateral Tapia's syndrome. However this is the first case reported in the literature in a liver transplanted patient. Most patients were male and young and the majority of cases appeared as a complication of airway manipulation after any type of surgery, closely related to the positioning of the head during the procedure. The diagnosis was founded on a rapid suspicion, a complete head and neck neurological examination and a computed tomography and or a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and neck to establish the origin of central or peripheral type of Tapia's syndrome and also the nature of the lesion, ischemia, abscess formation, tumor or hemorrhage. Apart from corticosteroids and anti- inflammatory therapy, the key of the treatment was an intensive and multidisciplinary speech and swallowing rehabilitation. Most studies have emphasized that the recovery is usually completed within four to six months. Conclusion: Tapia's syndrome is almost always a transient complication after airway manipulation. Although bilateral Tapia's syndrome after general anesthesia is exceptionally rare, this complication should be recognized in patients reporting respiratory obstruction with complete dysphagia and dysarthria after prolonged intubation. Both anesthesiologists and surgeons should be aware of the importance of its preventing measurements, prompt diagnosis and intensive speech and swallowing rehabilitation program.",

    "Abstract": "Progression through the cell cycle is controlled by the induction of cyclins and activation of cognate cyclin-dependent kinases. The human hepatitis B virus-X (HBV-X) protein functions in gene expression alterations, in the sensitization of cells to apoptotic killing and deregulates cell growth arrest in certain cancer cell types. We have pursued the mechanism of growth arrest in Hep3B cells, a p53-mutant human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line. In stable or transient HBV-X transformed Hep3B cells, HBV-X increased protein and mRNA levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21(waf1/cip1) increased binding of p21(waf1/cip1) with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), markedly inhibited cyclin E and CDK2 associated phosphorylation of histone H1 and induced the activation of a p21 promoter reporter construct. By using p21 promoter deletion constructs, the HBV-X responsive element was mapped to a region between -1185 and -1482, relative to the transcription start site. Promoter mutation analysis indicated that the HBV-X responsive site coincides with the ets factor binding sites. These data indicate that in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, HBV-X can circumvent the loss of p53 functions and induces critical downstream regulatory events leading to transcriptional activation of p21(waf1/cip1). As a consequence, there is an increased chance of acquisition of mutations which can enhance the genesis of hepatomas. Our results also emphasize the chemotherapeutic potential of p21(waf1/cip1) inhibitors, particularly in the HBV-X infected hepatoma which lacks functional p53.",

    "Abstract": "Notch signaling plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis; hence, perturbed Notch signaling may contribute to tumorigenesis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in Africa and Asia. The mechanisms that orchestrate the multiple oncogenic insults required for initiation and progression of HCC are not clear. We constitutively overexpressed active Notch1 in human HCC to explore the effects of Notch1 signaling on HCC cell growth and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. We show here that overexpression of Notch1 was able to inhibit the growth of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical analysis revealed the involvement of cell cycle regulated proteins in Notch1-mediated G(0)/G(1) arrest of HCC cells. Compared with green fluorescent protein (GFP) control, transient transfection of Notch1 ICN decreased expression of cyclin A (3.5-fold), cyclin D1 (2-fold), cyclin E (4.5-fold), CDK2 (2.8-fold), and the phosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein (3-fold). Up-regulation of p21(waf/cip1) protein expression was observed in SMMC7721-ICN cells stably expressing active Notch1 but not in SMMC7721-GFP cells, which only express GFP. Furthermore, a 12-fold increase in p53 expression and an increase (4.8-fold) in Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase activation were induced in SMMC7721-ICN cells compared with SMMC7721-GFP cells. In contrast, expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein could not be detected in SMMC7721-ICN cells. These findings suggest that Notch1 signaling may participate in the development of HCC cells, affecting multiple pathways that control both cell proliferation and apoptosis.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Polypectomy in the colon has been shown to prevent colorectal cancer in both the general population and in familial colorectal cancer. Individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer have an increased risk of the disease. Over a period of 10 years, 304 subjects at risk were included in ongoing surveillance with regular colonoscopies. To compile the medical findings and experience generated during this period, a retrospective cross sectional study was performed. Subjects: Subjects were classified into three family groups: families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC); families with hereditary colorectal cancer (HCC, non-Lynch syndrome); and a third group of families with only empirical risk estimates based on a family history of two close relatives (TCR) with colorectal cancer. Methods: The risk population was studied with regard to age at onset, prevalence, number, cancer risk, size, dysplasia, and distribution of adenomas. A comparison was made within the family groups and with a reference group representing the general population. Results: In total, 195 adenomas and six cancers were detected among 85 individuals. The relative risk of having an adenoma in the whole risk population compared with the general population was 2.6. Subjects from TCR families had most adenomas and HNPCC subjects had the least. A shift from proximal adenomas to distal carcinomas in families with HCC and TCR suggested a higher cancer risk in distal adenomas in these syndromes. HNPCC families showed a younger age at onset and adenomas with a higher degree of dysplasia. In HNPCC, there was a similar localisation of adenomas and carcinomas, suggesting a high risk of cancer in all adenomas. Conclusions: There was clear overrepresentation of adenomas in all three family types compared with the reference population. In HNPCC, we found earlier onset of adenomas and faster progression to cancer. Families with HCC, and even more so TCR subjects, had a later onset and lower risk of cancer from proximal adenomas. Based on these results, surveillance protocols in Sweden have been revised.",

There are few data on the presence or prevalence of EGFR mutations in hepatocellular and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. We studied exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene from 100 hepatocellular and 102 nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and found no exonic mutations of potential significance. Alternative mechanisms may be important for the observed activity of small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in hepatocellular and nasopharyngeal carcinomas.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To investigate the hepatic microcirculatory changes due to Haemoxygenase (HO), effect of HO inhibition on remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) and modulation of CINC. Methods: Eight groups of animals were studied - Sham, ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) the animals were subjected to 45 min of hepatic ischemia followed by three hours of reperfusion, RIPC (remote ischemic preconditioning) + IRI group, remote ischemic preconditioning in sham (RIPC + Sham), PDTC + IR (Pyridodithiocarbamate, HO donor), ZnPP + RIPC + IRI (Zinc protoporphyrin prior to preconditioning), IR-24 (45 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion), RIPC + IR-24 (preconditioning prior to IR). After 3 and 24 h of reperfusion the animals were killed by exsanguination and samples were taken. Results: Velocity of flow (160.83 ± 12.24 μm/s), sinusoidal flow (8.42 ± 1.19) and sinusoidal perfusion index (42.12 ± 7.28) in hepatic IR were lower (P < 0.05) in comparison to RIPC and PDTC (HO inducer). RIPC increased velocity of flow (328.04 ± 19.13 μm/s), sinusoidal flow (17.75 ± 2.59) and the sinusoidal perfusion index (67.28 ± 1.82) (P < 0.05). PDTC (HO induction) reproduced the effects of RIPC in hepatic IR. PDTC restored RBC velocity (300.88 ± 22.109 μm/s), sinusoidal flow (17.66 ± 3.71) and sinusoidal perfusion (82.33 ± 3.5) to near sham levels. ZnPP (HO inhibition) reduced velocity of flow of RBC in the RIPC group (170.74 ± 13.43 μm/s and sinusoidal flow in the RIPC group (9.46 ± 1.34). ZnPP in RIPC (60.29 ± 1.82) showed a fall in perfusion only at 180 min of reperfusion. Neutrophil adhesion in IR injury is seen in both postsinusoidal venules (769.05 ± 87.48) and sinusoids (97.4 ± 7.49). Neutrophil adhesion in RIPC + IR injury is reduced in both postsinusoidal venules (219.66 ± 93.79) and sinusoids (25.69 ± 9.08) (P < 0.05). PDTC reduced neutrophil adhesion in both postsinusoidal venules (89.58 ± 58.32) and sinusoids (17.98 ± 11.01) (P < 0.05) reproducing the effects of RIPC. ZnPP (HO inhibition) increased venular (589.04 ± 144.36) and sinusoidal neutrophil adhesion in preconditioned animals (121.39 ± 30.65) (P < 0.05). IR after 24 h of reperfusion increased venular and sinusoidal neutrophil adhesion in comparison to the early phase and was significantly reduced by RIPC. Hepatocellular cell death in IRI (80.83 ± 13.03), RIPC + IR (17.35 ± 2.47), and PTDC + IR (11.66 ± 1.17) reduced hepatocellular death. ZnPP + RIPC + IR (41.33 ± 3.07) significantly increased hepatocellular death (P < 0.05 PTDC/RIPC vs ZnPP and IR). The CINC cytokine levels in sham (101.32 ± 6.42). RIPC + sham (412.18 ± 65.24) as compared to sham (P < 0.05). CINC levels in hepatic IR were (644.08 ± 181.24). PDTC and RIPC CINC levels were significantly lower than hepatic IR (P < 0.05). HO inhibition in preconditioned animals with Zinc protoporphyrin increased serum CINC levels (521.81 ± 74.9) (P < 0.05). The serum CINC levels were high in the late phase of hepatic IR (15306 ± 1222.04). RIPC reduced CINC levels in the late phase of IR (467.46 ± 26.06), P < 0.05. Conclusion: RIPC protects hepatic microcirculation by induction of HO and modulation of CINC in hepatic IR.",

    "Abstract": "RNA component of mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease (RMRP) is a non-coding transcript firstly acknowledged for its association with the cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive condition. This transcript has been spotted in both nucleus and mitochondria. In addition to its role in the pathogenesis of CHH, RMRP participates in the pathogenesis of cancers. Independent studies in bladder cancer, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, breast carcinoma and multiple myeloma have confirmed the oncogenic effects of RMRP. Mechanistically, RMRP serves as a sponge for some miRNAs such as miR-206, miR-613, and miR-217. In addition to these miRNAs, expressions of tens of miRNAs have been altered following RMRP silencing, implying the vast extent of RMRP/miRNA network. In the present narrative review, we explain the role of RMRP in the development of cancers and some other non-malignant disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Sorafenib is the first regimen listed in the treatment algorithm for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC in a clinical practice using a nationwide population study. Methods: All patients registered with a diagnosis of primary HCC and identified as having been prescribed sorafenib between August 2012 and December 2015 were selected from a national database and retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes related to prescription of sorafenib for these patients were further assessed. Results: A total of 9,738 patients were enrolled and analyzed. As a result, 32.33% of patients had an initial treatment response and were eligible for the prescribed second term (240 tablets/ term) of sorafenib and 8.91% of patients received more than three terms of sorafenib. Meanwhile, the duration of sorafenib usage beyond 6 months was noted in 15.49% of patients, including 10.59% of patients with a period of usage between 6 and 12 months and 4.9% of patients with more than 12 months usage. Survival analysis showed that patients who received locoregional therapy plus sorafenib had significantly better survival rates than those who underwent only sorafenib treatment. Certain patients who underwent hepatectomy (n=12) or liver transplantation (n=13) were subsequently free of HCC. Conclusion: The disease control rate of sorafenib in advanced HCC patients in this study seemed similarly poorer as what has been previously reported by clinical trials. The combination of sorafenib and additional treatments could perhaps provide survival benefits and possibly cure disease in combination with surgical management.",

    "Abstract": "Data from germline testing in unselected patients with hepatobiliary cancers are limited. Identification of germline predisposition can have important implications on cancer treatment and family counseling. To determine prevalence of pathogenic germline variants (PGV) in patients with hepatobiliary cancer, we undertook a prospective multi-site study of germline sequencing using a >80-gene next-generation sequencing platform among patients with hepatobiliary cancers receiving care at Mayo Clinic Cancer Centers between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2020. Patients were not selected on the basis of stage, family cancer history, ethnicity, or age. Family cascade testing was offered at no cost. Of 205 patients, the median age was 65 years, 58.5% were male, 81% were White, and 64.4% had cholangiocarcinoma, 21.5% hepatocellular carcinoma, 7.8% gallbladder cancer, and 4.3% carcinoma of ampulla of Vater. PGV were found in 15.6% (n = 32) of patients, including 23 (71%) in moderate and high penetrance cancer susceptibility genes. A total of 75% of patients with a positive result would not have been detected using guidelines for genetic evaluation. Prevalence of PGV was 15.7% in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 17% in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 15.9% in hepatocellular cancer, and 33% in carcinoma of ampulla of Vater. On the basis of these genetic findings, 55% were potentially eligible for approved precision therapy and/or clinical treatment trials. Universal multi-gene panel testing in hepatobiliary cancers was associated with detection of heritable mutations in over 15% of patients most of whom would not have been tested using current guidelines. Germline testing should be considered in all patients with hepatobiliary cancers. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Universal multi-gene testing in hepatobiliary cancers was associated with heritable mutations in over 15% of patients, most of whom would not have been tested using current guidelines. 55% were potentially eligible for approved precision therapy and/or clinical treatment trials.

    "Abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C infection is a major cause of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. While hepatitis C has been treated for decades with some success, the introduction of direct acting antiviral agents has revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C with finite, highly effective, well-tolerated therapy and there are few populations that cannot be successfully treated now or are complicated to manage. The World Health Organization has released elimination targets in an effort to eliminate viral hepatitis and reduce dramatically the morbidity and mortality caused by both viral hepatitis. While hepatitis C is straightforward to treat, it remains problematic to eliminate on a global scale. Diagnosis of hepatitis C remains the major gap in the cascade of care and numerous screening strategies will be required to reduce this gap. While historically, treatment of hepatitis C has been centralized, decentralized approaches will be required to diagnose, evaluate, and link to care the large population of individuals worldwide with hepatitis C across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. With the introduction of multiple pangenotypic treatment options and reduced cost for these therapies, assessment and treatment for those with hepatitis C has been simplified and made more accessible worldwide. There are multiple populations for whom care models are being developed and refined, including those when inject drugs, those who are incarcerated, those who present with sexually transmitted disease including the men who have sex with men population, amongst many others. While a vaccine for hepatitis C remains elusive these efforts continue. Multiple successful elimination efforts have been reported.",

    "Abstract": "Frequent allelic losses on chromosome 10q have been reported in several types of cancers, suggesting the presence of a putative tumor suppressor gene(s) on the chromosomal arm. We examined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10q in 37 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) using eleven dinucleotide microsatellite markers, spanning the entire chromosome arm of 10q. Twelve (32%) out of 37 informative cases showed allelic losses of at least one locus on 10q and eight tumors showed a partial deletion of 10q. Analysis of deletion mapping of these eight cases identified two commonly deleted regions within the distal part of 10q (10q24-q26), a 20-cM interval flanked by D10S597 and D10S216 and a 24-cM interval flanked by D10S216 and D10S590. Moreover, we detected a somatic missense mutation (Met --> Val) of a candidate tumor suppressor gene PTEN / MMAC1, located at 10q23.3, in one HCC with LOH of 10q. Our findings indicated the presence of putative tumor suppressor gene(s) in the distal region of 10q that might be involved in the development and progression of HCC. Inactivation of PTEN / MMAC1 gene located outside the commonly deleted region of 10q might also play an important role in a subset of HCCs.",

Materials and methods: Records of nine patients who underwent TACE combined with simultaneous CBCT-guided multipolar MWA for massive HCC, between January and June 2015, were retrospectively reviewed. Technical success rate, blood levels of liver function indicators, complications, and tumor response one month after treatmentwere investigated. Results: The technical success rate of TACE combined with simultaneous MWA was 100%. The mean procedure time was 195.0 min (range, 125-350 min), the mean hospital stay after the treatment was 4.0 ± 1.0 days (range, 3-7 days), and no serious complications occurred. Minor complications were experienced by some patients but were relieved after conservative treatment. One month after treatment, enhanced CT revealed a complete response rate of 66.7% (6/9), a partial response rate of 22.2% (2/9), and a stable disease rate of 11.1% (1/9). Mild and reversible injury of liver function occurred in these patients. Conclusion: TACE combined with simultaneous CBCT-guided MWA for massive HCC was feasible and safe, and yielded a high response rate.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Lynch syndrome is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes with microsatellite instability (MSI) as its molecular hallmark. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been considered part of the tumor spectrum. The aim was to provide a detailed molecular characterization of an HCC associated with Lynch Syndrome (Muir-Torre variant). Materials and methods: HCC samples were analyzed for MSI, MMR protein expression and coding microsatellite instability (cMSI). Since cMSI also affected SEC63 coding for an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein with implications for intracellular protein translocation, its impact on hepatocyte growth control was assessed in an established short-term model. Recombinant inbred mouse lines (BXD) showing different basal SEC63 expression levels were treated with the chemocarcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) intraperitoneally. Proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocytes were determined after 48 h using Ki67 and TUNEL assays. Results: The HCC was high-grade microsatellite unstable with loss of MSH2 expression. cMSI was detected in four genes (ASTE1, SEC63, TAF1B, TGFBR2). However, only TGFBR2 is known to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. When investigating the impact of SEC63 expression on hepatocyte growth control in the murine model, low hepatic expression correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with a decrease in apoptosis and increased proliferative activity. Conclusions: For the first time, an HCC with characteristic molecular features of association with Lynch syndrome is described. The pro-carcinogenic growth behavior of hepatocytes with low SEC63 expression in the murine model indicates a potential role for SEC63 in hepatocarcinogenesis in general, but this needs further functional validation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus Sorafenib is recommended as one of the primary means for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This updated meta-analysis focuses on identifying the efficacy and safety of TACE plus Sorafenib versus TACE, which remains controversial despite years of exploration. Method: PubMed, Medline, Embase, China Journal Full-text Database, Wanfang Database, and Weipu Database were used to retrieve the studies which are about comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of TACE+Sorafenib with TACE alone. The Review Manager (Version 5. 3) software was used to perform a meta-analysis of the results of studies which met the inclusion criteria recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. Result: Compared with TACE for treating primary HCC, TACE combined with Sorafenib can improve the 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years overall survival rate (OS) of patients, respectively, and also improve disease control rate (DCR) and objective response rate (ORR). In terms of adverse reactions, the treatment group can lead to more complications significantly, such as hand-foot skin reaction, hypertension, diarrhea, rash, hair loss, and so on, most of which are relevant to Sorafenib related adverse reactions, but most patients have a good prognosis after symptomatic treatment. Conclusion: The clinical efficacy of TACE combined with Sorafenib in treating primary hepatocellular carcinoma is better than TACE, and the safety is acceptable.",

A hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic adenoma is frequently reported is such cases. However, hemoperitoneum resulting from a hepatic metastatic thymoma is extremely rare. Here, we present a case of a 62-year-old man with hypovolemic shock induced by ruptured hepatic metastasis from a thymoma. At the first hospital admission, the patient had a 45-mm anterior mediastinal mass that was eventually diagnosed as a type A thymoma. The mass was excised, and the patient was disease-free for 6 years. He experienced sudden-onset right upper quadrant pain and was again admitted to our hospital. We noted large hemoperitoneum with a 10-cm encapsulated mass in S5/8 and a 2.3-cm nodular lesion in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. He was diagnosed with hepatic metastasis from the thymoma, and he underwent chemotherapy and surgical excision.",

    "Abstract": "The cyclin D1 gene, CCND1, located within chromosome 11q13, plays an important role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression and has oncogenic properties. Cyclin D1 frequently is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as a result of gene amplification. In a previous study, we showed threefold to 20-fold amplification of CCND1 in four of 30 (13%) HCC tissues from Taiwan but not in any control liver tissues or in two HCC cell lines. A common A870G polymorphism located within the splice donor region of exon 4 of CCND1 has been reported to enhance alternate splicing. Two forms of mRNA are present in subjects with the heterozygous genotype. The relationship between the variant allele and susceptibility to HCC and clinical-pathologic outcome was investigated in 97 Taiwanese HCC patients and 35 control subjects. In this small sample, CCND1 genotype frequencies were similar in cases and controls and were not associated with susceptibility to the development of HCC. All nine patients homozygous for the G allele (GG genotype) had poorly differentiated tumors, but this association was not statistically significant, perhaps owing to the small sample. Overexpression of cyclin D1 protein, through gene amplification, correlates with poor prognosis in several cancers, but its role in HCC is the subject of controversy. Increased expression of cyclin D1 may play an important role in the development of HCC owing to the perturbation of normal control of the cell cycle. The A870G polymorphism in CCND1 may influence differentiation and prognosis in HCC patients but requires further study.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Experimental models with reversible biliary occlusion resulted in a high mortality of the animals, up to 20-60% according to the literature. Our aim was to assess a safe and valid technique for reversible biliary occlusion with a low mortality. Methods: We randomized 30 rats into two groups: with bile duct occlusion (BDO, n=18) and with sham manipulation of the extrahepatic bile duct (control, n=12). We used a removable vascular clip for temporary occlusion of the extrahepatic bile duct. The clip was removed on postoperative day (POD) 2. On POD 2, 3, and 5, we measured the hepatocellular injury and metabolic function markers in serum. Activation of mononuclear cells (HIS36) and expression of regeneration markers [cytokeratin 19, hepatic growth factor (HGF)-α, and HGF-β] were determined by immunohistochemistry. Results: The survival rate was 96.67% (1/30); one animal died. The mortality in the BDO group was 6% (1/18) and that in the control group was 0% (0/12). BDO resulted in a sharp increase of hepatocellular injury and cholestatic parameters on POD 2 with a rapid decline till POD 3. Significantly strongest activation of Kupffer cells and expression of proliferation markers were found until POD 5 after BDO. Conclusion: The clip technique is a safe, cheap, and valid method for reversible biliary occlusion with an extremely low mortality.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has well-defined environmental risk factors. In addition, epidemiologic studies have suggested hereditary risk factors. The goals of this study were to determine the rate of pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variants in cancer predisposition genes in patients with HCC, possible enrichment of P/LP variants in particular genes, and potential impact on clinical management. Materials and methods: A prospective study at a tertiary medical center enrolled 217 patients with a personal history of HCC. Multigene panel testing was performed for 134 cancer predisposition genes in all patients. The rate of P/LP variants was compared with population rates. A separate retrospective cohort included 219 patients with HCC who underwent testing at a commercial laboratory. Results: In the prospective cohort, P/LP germline variants were identified in 25 of 217 patients with HCC (11.5%). Four patients (1.8%) had P/LP variants in the highly penetrant cancer genes BRCA2 (n = 2), MSH6 (n = 1), and PMS2 (n = 1). In addition, multiple patients had P/LP variants in FANCA (n = 5) and BRIP1 (n = 4), which were significantly enriched in HCC compared with the general population. Detection of P/LP variants led to changes in clinical management in regard to therapy selection, screening recommendations, and cascade testing of relatives. In a separate retrospective analysis of 219 patients with HCC, 30 (13.7%) were positive for P/LP variants including 13 (5.9%) with highly penetrant genes APC (n = 2), BRCA1 (n = 1), BRCA2 (n = 6), MSH2 (n = 2), or TP53 (n = 2). Conclusion: P/LP germline variants in cancer predisposition genes were detected in 11%-14% of patients with HCC. Inherited genetics should not be overlooked in HCC as there are important implications for precision treatment, future risk of cancers, and familial cancer risk.",

The three compounds showed strong ferric reducing activities and effectively scavenged DPPH, ABTS(+), and singlet oxygen radicals. Among the three compounds tested, DGC showed the highest free radical scavenging capacity in human hepatoma HepG2 cells as assessed by oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dyes dichlorofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidium bromide. In addition, all three compounds effectively suppressed lipid peroxidation in rat tissues as well as H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production in hepatoma cells. This study demonstrates that among the three phenylflavonoids isolated from licorice, DGC possesses the most potent antioxidant activity, suggesting it has protective effects against chronic diseases caused by reactive oxygen species as well as potential as an antioxidant food additive.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is observed in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism that underlies this condition is unknown. In our study, we estimate the prevalence of GAVE in hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis and attempted to determine if any of the hepatocellular manifestations, liver functions, serum gastrin, abdominal ultrasound and endoscopic picture have a relation to, or could predict, the occurrence of GAVE in cirrhotic patients. Methods: This study includes 500 HCV-related liver cirrhosis patients. According to endoscopic assessment, we detected 30 patients with GAVE (Group 2). From the 470 patients without GAVE, we randomly selected 120 patients (Group 1), to avoid statistical bias, for comparison with Group 2. Comparison included clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, serum gastrin, ultrasound findings, and endoscopic findings (esophageal and/or gastric varices and gastropathy). Results: The percentage of GAVE in HCV-related liver cirrhosis is 0.06%. We can predict GAVE by platelets, palmer erythema, diabetes mellitus (DM), marked ascites > with area under the curve of 0.67, 75.5, 0.62, and 0.40%, and accuracy of 82.5, 72, 70.7, and 79.3%, respectively. There was no correlation found between occurrence of GAVE and endoscopic findings. Also, there was no correlation found between occurrence of GAVE and serum gastrin levels, which reflect another pathophysiology, and we found no statistically significant correlation with GAVE. Conclusions: Palmer erythema, low platelets, DM, and ascites might help in the prediction of GAVE. GAVE is not linked to the presence, type or grade of varices, and gastropathy.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Hepatectomy is the main curative method for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in China. Unfortunately, high recurrence rate after hepatectomy poses negative impact on the prognosis of patients. This study aimed to develop prognostic nomograms to predict early recurrence (ER) and late recurrence (LR) of HCC after curative hepatectomy. Patients and methods: Total of 318 HCC patients undergoing curative hepatectomy from January 2012 to January 2018 were retrospectively recruited. Potential risk factors that were significant for predicting ER and LR in univariate analysis were selected for multivariate survival model analysis using the backward stepwise method. Risk factors identified in multivariate analysis were used to develop nomograms to predict ER and LR. The nomogram was internally validated using 2,000 bootstrap samples from 75% of the original data. Results: Among 318 patients, 164 showed postoperative recurrence, of which 140 and 24 had ER (≤2 years) and LR (>2 years), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age, Hong Kong Liver Cancer Stage, albumin-bilirubin, METAVIR fibrosis grade, and microvascular invasion were risk factors of ER for HCC after curative hepatectomy. The AUC of the ROC curve for ER in the development set (D-set) was 0.888 while that in the validation set (V-set) was 0.812. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and glypican-3 (+) were risk factors for LR in HCC patients after curative hepatectomy. The AUC of the ROC curve for LR predictive nomogram that integrated all independent predictors was 0.831. The AUC of the ROC curve for LR in the D-set was 0.833, while that for LR in the V-set was 0.733. The C-index and AUC of ROC for the proposed nomograms were more satisfactory than three conventional HCC staging systems used in this study. Conclusion: We developed novel nomograms to predict ER and LR of HCC patients after curative hepatectomy for clinical use to individualize follow-up and therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Vascular complications following hepato-pancreatic biliary surgery can be devastating, and therefore precaution of them must be critical. We report two cases in which the pedicled omental transposition flap might be effective to avoid postoperative venous complications following major hepatectomy. Presentation of case: Case 1 is a 80-year-old male who required to perform re-laparotomy at postoperative day 1 following major hepatectomy due to acute portal venous thrombosis (PVT). In the second surgery, the main trunk of PV was occluded by thrombus resulted from its redundancy and kinking. PV was resected with an adequate length and reconstructed. The omental flap was placed between PV and inferior vena cava (IVC) to fill in the dead space, resulting in favorable intrahepatic portal blood flow. Case 2 is a 64-year-old male who underwent left trisectionectomy because of giant hepatocellular carcinoma located close to the trunk of right hepatic vein (RHV) and IVC. After removal of the specimens, the dead space developed between the RHV and IVC. In order to prevent outflow block caused by kinking of the RHV, the omental flap was placed between the RHV and IVC, and the right triangle ligament of the liver was fixed to the diaphragm. RHV patency was confirmed by postoperative imaging. Discussion: The omental flap is a simple procedure and useful to fill the dead space developed in the area surrounding major vessels. Conclusions: We experienced two cases in which vascular complications might be avoided by filling the dead space surrounding major vessels using the omental flap.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a subtype of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with a potentially progressive course to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis with its complications, or even hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is a rapidly growing chronic liver disease, with a global prevalence of about 25%, with a significant increase in the last 2 decades, changing the landscape of hepatology. This study aimed to undertake a bibliometric global analysis of research literature focusing on NASH. Methods: We searched the Scopus database to identify all articles pertaining to \"non-alcoholic steatohepatitis\" or \"NASH\" - the 2 keywords used to search in the title or abstract within the time period 1980 to 2018. The collected data included document type, author, journal, publication year, citation reports, country, and were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. Results: A total number of 6632 articles published in 1355 journals were retrieved. English was the predominant language of publication, USA being the most productive with 1937 articles published (29.2% of the total number of publications), followed by Japan with 909, representing 13.7% of publications. Hepatology, Journal of Hepatology and World Journal of Gastroenterology were the most active journals. Research articles were the most common type of publications (4524; 68.22%), followed by review articles (1359; 20.49%). The total number of citations received by all publications was 274,041, with an average of 41.32 per article (range: 0-4384). The average number of authors per article has increased in the last 2 decades, whereas the trend of single- (or few) authored publications has decreased. Conclusion: This study indicates that NASH is a significant topic in the hepatology research, as proved by the huge number of publications, recording an exponential growth in the last 2 decades. The USA stands out as by far the most productive country.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: After much debate, the International Consensus Group for Hepatocellular Neoplasia (ICGHN) has recently arrived at a conclusion regarding the pathological criteria for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They have stated that stromal invasion should be recognized as the most important pathological finding for precisely diagnosing and differentiating early HCC from dysplastic nodules (DN). Methods: We conducted a review of the imaging findings from multi-imaging modalities of early HCC cases diagnosed according to the pathological criteria of the ICGHN. The multi-imaging modalities included gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), abbreviated as EOB-MRI, contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT), CT during arterioportography (CTAP), and CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA). It has been shown that EOB-MRI is the only imaging modality that has sufficient resolution for the detection and classification of early HCC. Results: The most significant imaging feature for diagnosing early HCC was hypointensity on hepatobiliary-phase (HP) images of EOB-MRI; all of the cases of early HCC that were detected on HP images of EOB-MRI showed hypointensity, while all of the images of DN showed isointensity or hyperintensity compared with the liver parenchyma. The results of the diagnostic performance analysis showed that EOB-MRI had excellent sensitivity (97%) for detecting early HCC and outstanding specificity (100%) for distinguishing early HCC from DN. Conclusions: Considering the results from imaging-pathologic correlations and follow-up studies indicating that many early-stage hepatocellular nodules showing hypointensity on HP images of EOB-MRI tend to develop hypervascularization during a relatively short follow-up period, it is beginning to be accepted that such nodules may be treated as early HCC. However, hepatologists and radiologists should also recognize that some cases of early HCC may show isointensity or hyperintensity on HP images of EOB-MRI, making it impossible to differentiate early HCC from DN, although the low prevalence of such nodules may be unlikely to affect the generally accepted follow-up protocols for cirrhotic patients. Our results and other recent reports have indicated that signal-intensity patterns on HP images of EOB-MRI for DN and early HCC directly correlate with the degree of expression of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B3 in the nodules. Thus, the diagnostic performance of pathological analyses for early HCC cases may be dramatically improved, nearly up to that of EOB-MRI, by incorporating an OATP1B3 staining method.",

    "Abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the 10q23 chromosomal region was analyzed in 18 tissue samples from Korean hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. LOH at the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) region (D10S215, AFMa086wg9 and D10S541) was found in 8 of the 18 (44.4%) HCCs. LOH (20%) and microsatellite instability (26.7%) were also frequently found at the D10S2177 locus, which is located on the telomere side of the PTEN region. LOH was found in other loci, such as AFM280we1 and D10S2281. The presence of LOH in regions other than the PTEN region on chromosome 10q23 suggested the presence of additional tumor suppressor gene(s). PTEN mutation was found in only a subset of HCCs: A single base insertion at the end of the 5'-end splice signal (AG-GUAAGUU) in intron 5 and a silent mutation in exon 6 (codon 188, CTG-Val to CTA). Our data collectively suggest that the genetic alterations of chromosome 10q23, including the PTEN gene, could be important in hepatocarcinogenesis in the Korean population.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene have been identified in several types of human cancers and cancer cell lines, including brain, endometrial, prostate, breast, thyroid, and melanoma. In this study, we screened a total of 96 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from Taiwan, where HCC is the leading cancer in males and third leading cancer in females, for mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. Complete sequence analysis of these samples demonstrated a missense mutation in exon 5 (K144I) and exon 7 (V255A) from HCC samples B6-21 and B6-2, respectively. A putative splice site mutation was also detected in intron 3 from sample B6-2. Both B6-21 and B6-2 were previously shown to contain missense mutations in the coding sequences of the p53 gene. Functional studies with the two missense mutations demonstrated that while mutation V255A in exon 7 resulted in a loss of phosphatase activity, mutation K144I in exon 5 retained its phosphatase activity. Additionally, we identified a silent mutation (P96P) in exon 5 of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene from HCC sample B6-22. These data provide the first evidence that the PTEN/MMAC1 gene is mutated in a subset of HCC samples.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To study mutations of tumor suppressor gene PTEN in human hepatocellular carcinomas and its effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HHCC. Methods: (1) PCR-SSCP and sequence analysis were used to detect the mutations of the 5th and 8th exon of PTEN in 42 cases of human primary hepatocellular carcinoma. (2) Eukaryotic expression vectors of the wild-type (pEGFP-wt-PTEN) and the mutant type (pEGFP-PTEN, G129R) of PTEN were constructed. Lipofectamine 2000 mediated gene transfection was used to transfect hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HHCC, in which the PTEN protein is not expressed. Culture medium containing G418 was used to select stable transfectants. MTT colorimetry was used to analyze the proliferation ability of selected cell lines. Naive HHCC cells and HHCC cells transfected with empty vector (pEGFP-C1) served as controls. (3) TNF-alpha was used to induce apoptosis of selected cell clones. Results: (1) Point mutation involving the 5th exon of PTEN was detected in 4 of 42 primary hepatocellular carcinomas. (2) Compared with the control groups, the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was significantly inhibited by the transfection of wild-type PTEN gene, while the transfection with mutant PTEN construct did not significantly change the proliferation. (3) The apoptosis indices of cells transfected with the wild-type and the mutant PTEN genes were 13.8% and 8.1% respectively. Compared with the control, the apoptosis index of HHCC cell transfected by the wild type PTEN was significantly lower (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between HHCC cells transfected with mutated PTEN gene and the control (P > 0.05). The expression of internal 473-phosphorylated Akt of HHCC was weak, but was enhanced when the cells treated with TNF-alpha. However, it was down regulated by the wild type PTEN. Conclusions: (1) First time report that PTEN mutations can be found in 9.5% human primary hepatocellular carcinomas. (2) The expression of the wild-type PTEN can suppress the proliferation of HHCC cells, and such suppression was lost when PTEN gene was mutated. (3) PTEN inhibition of the proliferation and the enhancement of apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells is likely related to a down-regulation of the TNF-alpha induced activation of protein kinase Akt pathway.",

Wilms tumor (WT) is a malignant embryonal neoplasm of the kidney and is one of the most common solid tumors of childhood, occurring at an estimated frequency of 1 in 8000 to 10,000 births. Although second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) following therapy for WTs have been reported in the liver, the coexistence of HCC and WT is extremely rare. We present the first report of a synchronous anaplastic WT and FHCC in a previously healthy 4-year-old girl. Despite the presence of focal immunohistochemical positivity for p53 in the WT, molecular analysis failed to reveal a germline or somatic p53 mutation, and was inconclusive in establishing a clonal relation between the two tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Genetic detection for the diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in China has low sensitivity and specificity. Better gene detection is urgently needed to distinguish testing subjects. We proposed to use numerous and weighted clinical traits as key indicators for reasonable genetic testing to predict the probability of MODY in the Chinese population. Methods: We created a prediction model based on data from 306 patients, including 140 patients with MODY, 84 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and 82 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: Compared with patients with T1D, patients with MODY had higher C-peptide levels and negative antibodies, and most patients with MODY had a family history of diabetes. Different from T2D, MODY was characterized by lower body mass index and younger diagnostic age. A clinical prediction model was established to define the comprehensive probability of MODY by a weighted consolidation of the most distinguishing features, and the model showed excellent discrimination (areas under the curve of 0.916 in MODY vs T1D and 0.942 in MODY vs T2D). Further, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, glycated hemoglobin A1c, 2-h postprandial glucose, and triglyceride were used as indicators for glucokinase-MODY, while triglyceride, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and hepatocellular adenoma were used as indicators for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-α MODY. Conclusion: We developed a practical prediction model that could predict the probability of MODY and provide information to identify glucokinase-MODY and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-α MODY. These results provide an advanced and more reasonable process to identify the most appropriate patients for genetic testing.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The prospect for targeted therapies in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has dramatically changed since several recent clinical trials have yielded promising results. The number of second-line therapies is increasing, though the consequent challenge is to consider differences between these interventions. This is a comparative investigation of presently approved second-line drugs for HCC based on findings from phase III randomized controlled trials. Methods: Data related to treatment efficacy including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) were extracted and compared using a Bayesian approach. Adverse events (AEs) and the rate of discontinuation due to AEs were assessed and compared with provide a more complete understanding. OS and PFS in patients with alpha fetoprotein (AFP) values greater than 400 were compared and ranked as a subgroup. Results: A total of five trials involving 2571 patients were included. The comparison suggests that regorafenib and cabozantinib significantly prolong OS compared with placebo. The rate of AEs and treatment discontinuation did not significantly differ, although the types of AEs varied substantially. Subgroup analysis did not highlight a significant OS difference between regorafenib [hazard ratio (HR) 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.92], cabozantinib (HR 0.71; CI 0.54-0.94) and ramucirumab (HR 0.69; CI 0.57-0.84). Conclusion: Among the four second-line HCC therapies compared, regorafenib and cabozantinib appear to be better choices in terms of OS. Cabozantinib, regorafenib and ramucirumab have similar levels of efficacy for those with AFP >400, although ramucirumab has fewer side effects. No significant difference was observed in AEs, but some AEs related to each of these interventions should be given further consideration.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective: Sorafenib is recommended for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, it is frequently discontinued because of adverse events, which greatly affects its therapeutic effects. Furthermore, because patients treated with sorafenib for a long period can presumably tolerate adverse events, this study aimed to identify their characteristics and analyze factors affecting the therapeutic effects of the drug. Subjects and methods: Seventeen patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who received sorafenib for 12 months or longer at our hospital between January 2009 and October 2015 were included. In these 17 patients, factors affecting the time to untreatable progression were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier curve, and log-rank test. Results: In the 17 patients, the mean sorafenib dose was 433 mg/day. The drug was discontinued in 12 patients, 9 (75%) of whom discontinued it because of progressive disease. The median time to untreatable progression was 23.1 months. The contributors to favorable therapeutic effects included administration of at least two sessions of concomitant therapy after initiating sorafenib therapy, a low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and a decreased total bilirubin level. Conclusion: Achieving favorable therapeutic effects of sorafenib requires strict dose adjustment that allows better control of adverse events and long-term administration of the drug. Furthermore, combining sorafenib with other therapies, a low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and a decreased total bilirubin level are useful predictors of favorable effects.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Several systemic agents have been approved for use in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). However, it is unclear which treatment is superior in either the first- or second-line settings due to the paucity of head-to-head comparative trials. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis for the indirect comparison of the systemic agents in the first line and second line settings. Methods: Randomized clinical trials evaluating systemic agents in first and second line settings in aHCC from inception to April 2020 were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Databases and the annual ASCO and ESMO conferences from 2017 to 2020. Studies in English reporting clinical outcomes including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR) were included. The primary outcomes of interest were pooled hazard ratios (HR) of OS and pooled odds ratios (OR) of ORR in first line studies and pooled HR of PFS and OR of ORR for second line studies. Additionally, OS for second line agents were reported in the qualitative analysis. Results: Overall, first line studies comprised 8335 patients (13 studies) and second line studies comprised 4612 patients (11 studies). In the first line setting, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with the highest OS benefit over sorafenib (HR 0.58, 95% CI, 0.42-0.80; P-score 0.993). Additionally, lenvatinib was associated with the greatest ORR benefit (OR 3.34, 95% CI, 2.17-5.14; P-score 0.080) in the first line setting. In the second line setting, cabozantinib was associated with the highest PFS benefit over placebo (HR 0.44, 95% CI, 0.29-0.66; P-score 0.854) as well as the highest ORR benefit (OR 9.40, 95% CI, 1.25-70.83, P-score, 0.266). Conclusion: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab appears to have superior efficacy among first line agents whereas cabozantinib appears to be superior in the second line setting. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the type of prior therapy received affects the efficacy of subsequent second line therapy.",

    "Abstract": "A common deletion polymorphism within B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia-lymphoma like 11 gene (BIM) was deemed to be a genetic cause leading to compromised kinase inhibitor therapeutic efficacy in cancer individuals. However, the results reported were not consistent. Thus, a comprehensive meta-analysis containing 12 eligible studies including 1,532 Asian patients was conducted to investigate a steady and reliable conclusion. The results showed that BIM deletion polymorphism was significantly associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) clinical efficacy in term of response rate (Ph = 0.349, HR = 0.438, 95%CI = 0.274-0.699) and disease control rate (Ph = 0.941, HR = 0.370, 95%CI = 0.202-0.678) in EGFR-mutated NSCLC population, not in CML and HCC subgroups. Additionally, EGFR-mutated NSCLC patient harbored BIM deletion polymorphism was associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those with BIM wild polymorphism (Ph = 0.580, adjusted HR = 2.194, 95%CI = 1.710-2.814). However, no significant association was examined between BIM deletion polymorphism and overall survival (OS) and toxic adverse events in EGFR-mutated NSCLC population and it was not associated with PFS and OS in HCC subgroup. These findings revealed that BIM deletion polymorphism might be a genetic cause of intrinsic resistance to TKI therapy and it could be emerged as an independent predictor to identify patients who would benefit from TKI targeted therapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of our study was to validate the value of combined preoperative prognostic nutritional index and body mass index in predicting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients who underwent treatment of transarterial chemoembolization. Methods: A single-centered retrospective study of 285 unresectable HCC patients who received treatment of transarterial chemoembolization from January 2013 to June 2015 was conducted. In our retrospective analysis, preoperative PNI and BMI data of patients were calculated and analyzed. The data of patient demographic, clinical, pathological and hematological characteristics were also systematically acquired and analyzed. Results: Low PNI was correlated with cirrhosis, AFP ≥ 200 mg/L, Child-Pugh class B, ALT and AST ≥ 40 IU/L, TBIL≥21μmol/L, vascular invasion, tumor size ≥5 cm BCLC A/B and TNM III-IV stages (all p < 0.05). Likewise, low BMI was related to AFP ≥ 200 mg/L, Child-Pugh class B, AST ≥ 40IU/L, tumor size ≥5 cm, vascular invasion, BCLC C and TNM III-IV stages (all p < 0.05). In our multivariate analysis, AFP levels, tumor size, PNI and BMI were identified as independent predictive factors for OS and PFS of patients (all p < 0.05). Prominently, low PNI combined with low BMI adversely affected the overall survival and disease-free survival and the combination of PNI-BMI scores was proved to be the superior distinguished capacity compared with PNI or BMI alone because of higher area under the curve. Conclusion: Preoperative PNI and BMI are independent predictors for prognosis in intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients after transarterial chemoembolization treatment. The PNI and BMI combination can promote the accuracy of prognostic prediction for patients with HCC compared with single score.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chronic liver disease (CLD) is common in Bangladesh; however, a major bulk remains as cryptogenic CLD as they remain devoid of known pathological agents leading to have a check of Kayser-Fleischer (K-F) rings for possible Wilson's disease (WD) and many of these patients develop complications such as cirrhosis of liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there remains considerable proportions of CLD patients with undefined etiology (cryptogenic CLD) and these patients cannot be provided effective therapy based on etiological factors. Here, the proportion of WD among cryptogenic CLD patients in Bangladesh has been evaluated to improve the management of CLD and reduce complications. Materials and methods: A total of 941 patients with cryptogenic CLD [negative for hepatitis viruses, alcohol, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), drug, and autoimmunity] were enrolled in the study. To assess if they have been suffering from WD, the levels of copper in 24-hour urine were evaluated. Definitive WD was diagnosed when 24-hour urinary copper output was >100 μg and strongly indicative WD patients excreted >40 μg of copper in 24 hours. Results: Out of 941 patients with cryptogenic CLD, 212 patients were diagnosed as definitive WD and 239 patients as strongly indicative WD on the basis of 24-hours copper excretion. The age distribution ranging of the patients varied from 1 year to 90 years. There was a male predominance. Considerable numbers of WD patients had previous history of jaundice. Kayser-Fleischer rings were mostly uncommon and detected in five patients with WD only. Discussion: Wilson's disease is not a rare entity in Bangladesh; rather, it seems to be fairly common among CLD patients. A country-wide epidemiological survey should be conducted for diagnosis of WD in Bangladesh to provide a proper management strategy for these huge numbers of WD patients. In fact, most of the WD patients are unaware of their diagnosis and the general physicians are equally unaware of diagnosis and management of WD.

    "Abstract": "Cdc6 is essential for DNA replication and its deregulation is involved in carcinogenesis. To date, the biological significance of the polymorphism in Cdc6 promoter is still unknown. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of the Cdc6 -515A>G polymorphism (rs4134994) on the individual's susceptibility to cancer and on the function of Cdc6. The Cdc6 -515A>G polymorphism was genotyped in 387 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 389 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The association between the genotypes and the risk for HCC was then estimated by unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex and HBV status. Compared with the AA homozygotes, the homozygous GG genotype (adjusted OR=0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.18-0.72, P=0.004) or the combined AG/GG genotypes (adjusted OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.36-0.86, P=0.008) were statistically significantly associated with the reduced risk for HCC. Moreover, the analysis using luciferase reporter system showed that the G-allelic Cdc6 promoter displayed a decreased transcriptional activity compared with the A-allelic one. These results indicate that the individuals with G allele may have reduced Cdc6 expression and are therefore in reduced risk for HCC. Further investigation using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the G allele had a stronger binding strength to nuclear protein(s) which might function as negative regulator(s) for Cdc6 transcription. Our findings suggest that the -515A>G polymorphism may affect the Cdc6 promoter binding affinity with nuclear protein(s) and in turn the Cdc6 expression, which consequently modulates the individual's susceptibility to HCC.",

    "Abstract": "CiC (citrate carrier), a mitochondrial membrane protein, plays an important metabolic role by transporting acetyl-CoA into the cytosol for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Several studies showed that CiC activity and expression is regulated by dietary fatty acids. In the present study we report data on the structural and functional characterization of the 5'-flanking region of the rat Cic gene. By transient transfection assays in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells, a PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) response region has been identified within the CiC promoter. A cluster of putative binding sites for several transcription factors, composed of a NF-Y (nuclear factor-Y) site, an E-box-like site, a SRE1 (sterol regulatory element 1)-like site and four Sp1 (stimulatory protein 1) sites, was localized in the promoter region. Luciferase reporter gene and gel mobility shift assays indicated that a functional E-box-like, essential to the basal CiC promoter activity, confers responsiveness to activation by SREBP (SRE-binding protein)-1c. This study provides evidence for SREBP-1c as a principal target for PUFA regulation of CiC transcription. In H4IIE cells, overexpression of nSREBP (nuclear SREBP)-1c over-rides arachidonic acid (C(20:4, n-6)) suppression, but does not prevent the repression by docosahexaenoic acid (C(22:6, n-3)). ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays in H4IIE cells showed that docosahexaenoic acid affects the binding of NF-Y, Sp1 and SREBP-1 to the PUFA response region of CiC promoter, whereas arachidonic acid alters only the binding of SREBP-1. Our data show that PUFA inhibition of hepatic Cic gene transcription is mediated not only by the nuclear level of SREBP-1c, but also might involve a reduction in Sp1 and NF-Y DNA binding, suggesting differential mechanisms in the Cic gene regulation by different PUFA.",

We aimed to develop sensitive and noninvasive biomarkers in saliva for detecting early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Candidate lncRNA biomarkers identified by Agilent microarray were subjected to validation using qPCR for the quantification of their expression levels in independent tissue, plasma and saliva sample sets, including healthy controls, HBsAg carriers, patients with chronic Hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, early HCC, and advanced HCC. Levels of candidate biomarkers were also measured in totally 108 saliva samples from patients with any one of other nine leading causes of cancer death in men and women. Findings: Lnc-PCDH9-13:1 was significantly elevated in HCC tissues, plasma and saliva of HCC patients compared with healthy controls and groups of several benign liver diseases and other leading cancers. Its level was significantly reduced after curative hepatectomy but significantly elevated again if HCC recurrence occurred. Salivary lnc-PCDH9-13:1 showed reasonable specificities and sensitivities for detecting HCC compared with several control groups. Furthermore, the overexpression of lnc-PCDH9-13:1 promotes cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Interpretation: Salivary lnc-PCDH9-13:1 is a desirable biomarker for early HCC. It may help warrant prospective validation with larger sample sizes in multi-centers.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The \"six-and-twelve\" prognostic score was proposed recently to predict survival rate in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, it has not been validated externally. We validated this score and previous prognostic scores in Thai HCC patients treated with TACE. Methods: We identified all HCC patients who underwent TACE between January 2007 and December 2018 at our hospital. The inclusion criteria were treatment-naive, unresectable HCC BCLC-A and BCLC-B; if cirrhosis was present, Child-Pugh score ≤7; and baseline performance status 0-1. Results: Of 716 HCC patients undergoing TACE, 281 (mean age, 61.1 years; 73.0% men, 92.2% with cirrhosis) were eligible. Approximately half of the patients had hepatitis B virus. Median overall survival was 20.3 (95% confidence interval, 16.4-26.3) months. By stratifying with the \"six-and-twelve\" score (≤6, >6-12, >12), median (95% confidence interval) overall survival was 35.1 (26.4-53.0), 16.0 (11.6-22.6), and 7.6 (5.4-14.9) months, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) predicting death at 1, 2, and 3 years for the \"six-and-twelve\" score were 0.714, 0.700, and 0.688, respectively. Compared with the other currently available scores, the AUROC predicting death at 1 year for the \"six-and-twelve\" score was the most predictive and better than other models except the up-to-seven model. Discussion: Our study confirms the value of the \"six-and-twelve\" score to predict survival rate of unresectable HCC treated with TACE. However, in our validation cohort, AUROC of the \"six-and-twelve\" score was slightly lower than that of the original Chinese cohort (0.73).",

    "Abstract": "Using a small scale ENU mutagenesis approach we identified a recessive germline mutant, designated Lampe1 that exhibited growth retardation and spontaneous hepatosteatosis. Low resolution mapping based on 20 intercrossed Lampe1 mice revealed linkage to a ∼14 Mb interval on the distal site of chromosome 11 containing a total of 285 genes. Exons and 50 bp flanking sequences within the critical region were enriched with sequence capture microarrays and subsequently analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Using this approach 98.1 percent of the targeted DNA was covered with a depth of 10 or more reads per nucleotide and 3 homozygote mutations were identified. Two mutations represented intronic nucleotide changes whereas one mutation affected a splice donor site in intron 11-12 of Palmitoyl Acetyl-coenzyme A oxygenase-1 (Acox1), causing skipping of exon 12. Phenotyping of Acox1(Lampe1) mutants revealed a progression from hepatosteatosis to steatohepatitis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. The current approach provides a highly efficient and affordable method to identify causative mutations induced by ENU mutagenesis and animal models relevant to human pathology.",

We report a case of benign hypervascular hyperplastic nodules in a 41-year-old male patient without hepatitis B or C virus infection, with a history of alcohol abuse, and diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm. The dynamic computerized tomography of the liver demonstrated multiple nodular lesions on both liver lobes with arterial enhancement and delayed washout. The hepatic angiography showed multiple faint nodular staining of both lobes in the early arterial phase. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed numerous nodules showing high signals on T1 weighted images, with some nodules showing a low central signal portion. The clinical impression was HCC. The ultrasonography-guided liver biopsy, which was performed on the largest nodule (2.5 cm in size), revealed hepatocellular nodules with slightly increased cellularity, unpaired arteries, increased sinusoidal capillarization, and focal iron deposition. However, both cellular and cytological atypia were unremarkable. Although the clinical impression was HCC, the pathological diagnosis was hypervascular hyperplastic nodules in alcoholic cirrhosis. Differential diagnosis of hypervascular nodules in cirrhosis and HCC is difficult with imaging studies; thus, histological confirmation is mandatory.",

    "Abstract": "VHL is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3 that is classically associated with tumors of the eye and CNS, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma. We describe what appears to be the first report of an association between a germline VHL mutation and non-small cell lung cancer and metachronous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our case involves a 63-year-old nonsmoking male who was initially diagnosed with EGFR mutation-positive metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma, who subsequently developed HCC and squamous cell carcinoma of the femur despite first-line treatment with EGFR-blocking osimertinib. Caris molecular profiling unexpectedly identified a shared underlying VHL mutation in all 3 lesions. Genetic mapping through a machine learning-based tool called Genomic Prevalence Score (GPSai™) helped determine that the femur tumor was a metastatic lesion as opposed to a separate primary and that the HCC was a distinct primary malignancy. We not only highlight the association between these tumors and a VHL mutation but also emphasize the value of next-generation sequencing and a molecular disease classifier in a patient with multiple primaries, how it helps guide therapy, and its value in guiding future studies.",

This study aimed at characterizing the mutational profile of HCC. Methods: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 40 HCC using a 102-gene panel including, among others, the MAPK, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, and Notch pathways. HCC was widely invasive in 57.5%, and lymph node and distant metastases were diagnosed in 5% and 7.5% of cases. During follow-up, 10% of patients presented with persistent/recurrent disease, but there were no cancer-related deaths. Results: Genetic alterations were identified in 47.5% of HCC and comprised 190 single-nucleotide variants and 5 insertions/deletions. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway was most frequently affected (30%), followed by MAPK (27.5%) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR (25%). FAT1 and APC were the most frequently mutated genes and present in 17.5%. RAS mutations were present in 12.5% but no BRAF mutation was found. There was no association between the mutational profile and clinicopathological features. Conclusions: This series of HCC presents a wide range of mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin, MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. The recurrent involvement of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, particularly mutations in APC and FAT1, are of particular interest. The data suggest that mutated FAT1 may represent a potential novel driver in HCC tumorigenesis and that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a critical role in this distinct thyroid malignancy.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MT1JP on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro. Patients and methods: Thirty pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissues were collected from HCC patients. Tissue pathology and MT1JP expression were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. The correlation between MT1JP and HCC prognosis was investigated. MTT assays, cloning, flow cytometry, transwell assays, and wound-healing assays were used to evaluate the effects of MT1JP on HCC cell lines. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to measure the relative mRNA and protein expression levels. Results: The expression of MT1JP was downregulated in HCC tumor tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues, while the percent survival was significantly greater in the high MT1JP expression group than in the low MT1JP expression group (P=0.0238). In vitro, overexpression of MT1JP suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration, reduced colony cell number, increased cell apoptosis, and induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest in Bel-7402 and Huh-7 cells. Meanwhile, the mRNA and protein expression levels of RUNX3 and P21 were significantly upregulated, whereas those of MMP2 and MMP9 were significantly downregulated, in Bel-7402 and Huh-7 cells overexpressing MT1JP (all P<0.001). Conclusion: LncRNA MT1JP may function as a tumor suppressor in HCC. Overexpression of MT1JP suppressed HCC cell biological activities through the regulation of RUNX3.",

    "Abstract": "There are only 13 cases of complete remission after sorafenib use in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. We herein report a rarer case in which the patient was cured after only 20 days of sorafenib use. A 61-year-old male patient was diagnosed with a huge HCC. The mass occupied almost the whole of the right hepatic lobe and a portion of segment 4. We performed extended right hepatectomy for cure. However, 3.5-cm-sized subcarinal lymph node metastasis was detected at 15 months after operation. We prescribed sorafenib 400 mg bid for palliative treatment. The patient had severe fever, pain, and blisters on the hands and feet, so the patient stopped taking it after 20 days. Subcarinal lymph node disappeared on chest computed tomography after 3 months, and there was no evidence of recurrence for a year.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Long-term real-world data are relatively sparse regarding recurrence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after liver transplantation using hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) and nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) prophylaxis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from 371 adults transplanted for HBV-related disease at 20 European centers and given HBIg for ³12 months ± NUC therapy were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS HBIg comprised Hepatect® (iv HBIgB; n=299), subcutaneous Zutectra® (sc HBIg, n=236), and other HBIg preparations (n=130); 93.5% received NUC therapy. Mean follow-up was 6.8±3.5 years. The primary efficacy variable, freedom from HBV recurrence, occurred in 95.7% of patients (95% CI [93.1%, 97.5%]). The observed incidence of recurrence was 16/371 (4.3%) (annual rate 0.65%); 5/16 patients with recurrence had discontinued HBIg and 7/16 had anti-HBs <100 IU/l. Excluding these 7 patients, the HBV recurrence rate was 2.4%. The recurrence rate while on HBIg therapy was 1 per 2069 months. In patients who discontinued HBIg, risk of HBV recurrence versus sc HBIg users was increased by 5.2-fold (1 per 1 603 versus 1 per 8379 treatment months). The annual rate of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence was 1.7%. CONCLUSIONS These results support the long-term use of HBIg with NUC therapy as an effective management strategy to minimize risk of HBV recurrence and virus-related complications after liver transplantation.",

    "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies found that hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV-3) infection was associated with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in immunocompromised patients. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between the host immunosuppressive status and the occurrence of HEV-related chronic hepatitis. Here we describe a successful experimental study, using cynomolgus monkeys previously treated with tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant, and infected with a Brazilian HEV-3 strain isolated from naturally infected pigs. HEV infected monkeys were followed up during 160 days post infection (dpi) by clinical signs; virological, biochemical and haematological parameters; and liver histopathology. The tacrolimus blood levels were monitored throughout the experiment. Immunosuppression was confirmed by clinical and laboratorial findings, such as: moderate weight loss, alopecia, and herpes virus opportunistic infection. In this study, chronic HEV infection was characterized by the mild increase of liver enzymes serum levels; persistent RNA viremia and viral faecal shedding; and liver histopathology. Three out of four immunosuppressed monkeys showed recurrent HEV RNA detection in liver samples, evident hepatocellular ballooning degeneration, mild to severe macro and microvesicular steatosis (zone 1), scattered hepatocellular apoptosis, and lobular focal inflammation. At 69 dpi, liver biopsies of all infected monkeys revealed evident ballooning degeneration (zone 3), discrete hepatocellular apoptosis, and at most mild portal and intra-acinar focal inflammation. At 160 dpi, the three chronically HEV infected monkeys showed microscopic features (piecemeal necrosis) corresponding to chronic hepatitis in absence of fibrosis and cirrhosis in liver parenchyma. Within 4-months follow up, the tacrolimus-immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys infected with a Brazilian swine HEV-3 strain exhibited more severe hepatic lesions progressing to chronic hepatitis without liver fibrosis, similarly as shown in tacrolimus-immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. The cause-effect relationship between HEV infection and tacrolimus treatment was confirmed in this experiment.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation in patients with incompletely treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and to evaluate possible prognostic factors for this therapy. Subjects and methods: Thirty nine patients with incompletely treated single HCC (≤ 5 cm) after TACE were treated with RF ablation. All patients were evaluated for complete tumor ablation rate, local recurrence-free rate, overall survival rate, and complications. Local recurrence-free rate and overall survival rate were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The possible prognostic factors of local recurrence-free rate and survival rate were analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards regression model. Results: The complete tumor ablation rate was 92.3%. Local recurrence-free rates for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-years were 81.7%, 63.1%, 53.6%, and 35.7%, respectively. One-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 96.9%, 82.9%, 67.8%, and 48.4%, respectively. Among prognostic factors included in the analysis, only tumor diameter (≤ 2 cm versus > 2 cm) was statistically significant in terms of predicting local recurrence. Complications were observed in two patients, one with liver abscess and the other with portal venous thrombosis. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided RF ablation could be effective and safe in treating incompletely treated HCC after TACE. The diameter of HCC was a significant prognostic factor for local recurrence.",

We searched various databases for studies published in English or Chinese up to February 28, 2014. The hazard ratio for overall survival and analyzed odds ratio were combined to evaluate the clinicopathological features of HIF-2α expression in HCC. Results: A total of 7 eligible studies comprising 1066 patients with HCC were identified after our full assessment according to inclusion criteria. All of the patients came from China. The results indicated that the association between HIF-2α expression and prognostic values in HCC was inconspicuous, while the expression of HIF-2α was significantly associated with capsule infiltration, vein invasion, and histological grade. Conclusion: Expression of HIF-2α was associated with invasion and metastasis in HCC, but did not have a distinct significance in prognosis, according to the limited evidence. However, high quality, large sample size, and controlled trials are required.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: In 2010, we established the Miyazaki Comprehensive Hearing Care Network (MCHCN) for early identification and intervention in children with congenital and late-onset/acquired hearing loss with the cooperation of related administrative bodies in Miyazaki prefecture. The central roles of the MCHCN program are played by the Hearing Care Center (HCC) at the University of Miyazaki Hospital established in 2010 to facilitate audiological diagnoses, hearing aid interventions, and educational efforts, as well as linkage with the Department of Otolaryngology for surgical interventions. Herein, we aimed to present the main outcomes of the MCHCN program organized by the HCC at the University of Miyazaki Hospital. Methods: The MCHCN consists of two different networks, the Newborn Hearing Screening Network (NHSN) and the Pediatric Hearing Care Network (PHCN). All children suspected of having hearing loss by Newborn Hearing Screening (NHS) are referred to the HCC via the NHSN. In addition, children suspected of late-onset/acquired hearing loss by municipality-led health checkups, pediatricians, public health nurses, and childcare workers are referred to the HCC via the PHCN. Children who were born in Miyazaki prefecture between January 2010 and December 2017 and referred to the HCC for detailed hearing examination were included in this study. Results: Within the study period, 89,390 infants were born in Miyazaki prefecture, and 84,737 (94.9%) of them underwent NHS. A total of 698 infants and 182 children with suspected hearing loss were referred to the HCC via the NHSN and PHCN, respectively. Of the 880 referrals, 169 were diagnosed with hearing loss, which included 80 children with bilateral hearing loss and 89 children with unilateral hearing loss. Of the 80 children with bilateral hearing loss, 76 began wearing hearing aids and 15 had cochlear implants in the follow-up period. In children with bilateral conductive hearing loss, 4 children with bilateral middle ear anomalies underwent ossiculoplasty, following which two of these children no longer required hearing aids. Imaging assessments performed on 71 of the 89 children with unilateral hearing loss revealed that 20 of the 30 (66%) children who underwent CT exhibited ossicular anomalies and 28 out of the 48 (58%) children who underwent MRI were found to have ipsilateral cochlear nerve hypoplasia. Among the 169 children with hearing loss, no follow-up loss was observed during the period of this study. Conclusion: The MCHCN that was organized at the initiative of the HCC at the University of Miyazaki Hospital has enabled the provision of comprehensive and continuous support, ranging from diagnosis to intervention, not only for children with suspected hearing loss referred based on their NHS results but also for those who pass the screening. Via this system, children with late-onset/acquired hearing loss can be identified early and can receive medical interventions tailored to the cause of their hearing loss while simultaneously avoiding a loss to follow-up.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Although the clinical success rate for the treatment of early-stage HCC has improved, the prognosis of advanced HCC remains poor owing to the high recurrence rate and the refractory nature of HCC for various anticancer drugs. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of HCC is therefore critically needed in order to treat HCC, including its genetic alterations. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has provided an unbiased platform to systematically identify gene mutations and reveal the pathogenesis of various cancers. In the present study, a total of 118 samples (59 liver tissues including cancer and adjacent normal tissues) were sequenced using the AmpliSeq Hotspot Cancer Panel (version 2). The most common somatic mutations identified were tumor protein 53 (TP53; 35.6%) and β-catenin 1 (CTNNB1; 30.5%), and the most frequent variants of those genes were missense variants. In addition, somatic mutations including those in genes encoding colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (5.1%), epidermal growth factor receptor (6.8%), RET proto-oncogene (3.4%), Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4; 1.7%) and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11, also known as liver kinase B1; 6.8%) were also identified at a low frequency in patients with HCC. A frameshift variant in STK11, a splice acceptor variant in TP53, a splice region variant in ERBB4 and a stop-gained variant in TP53 were also specifically determined. The most abundant alteration was a C:G>T:A transition (50%) and other transversions, i.e., C:G>G:C (19.6%), T:A>C:G (19.6%), C:G>A:T (12.5%), T:A>G:C (12.5%) and T:A>A:T (5.4%). This spectrum pattern differs from that in other solid tumors. TP53 mutations in the tumors at advanced stages were significantly more frequent compared with those in early-stage tumors. Additionally, age (<70 vs. ≥70 years) was significantly associated with CTNNB1 mutations. Using NGS, a number of novel gene mutations were identified in HCC, including established mutations and disproved mutations. The results of the present study offer new insight and improved understanding of the etiology and the development of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic necroinflammatory disease of the liver characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia, characteristic autoantibodies, association with HLA DR3 or DR4 and a favorable response to immunosuppressive treatment. The etiology is unknown. The detection of non-organ and liver-related autoantibodies remains the hallmark for the diagnosis of the disease in the absence of viral, metabolic, genetic, and toxic etiology of chronic hepatitis or hepatic injury. The current classification of AIH and the several autoantibodies/target-autoantigens found in this disease are reported. Current aspects on the significance of these markers in the differential diagnosis and the study of pathogenesis of AIH are also stated. AIH is subdivided into two major types; AIH type 1 (AIH-1) and type 2 (AIH-2). AIH-1 is characterized by the detection of smooth muscle autoantibodies (SMA) and/or antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Determination of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), antibodies against the asialoglycoprotein receptor (anti-ASGP-R) and antibodies against to soluble liver antigens or liver-pancreas (anti-SLA/LP) may be useful for the identification of patients who are seronegative for ANA/SMA. AIH-2 is characterized by the presence of specific autoantibodies against liver and kidney microsomal antigens (anti-LKM type 1 or infrequently anti-LKM type 3) and/or autoantibodies against liver cytosol 1 antigen (anti-LC1). Anti-LKM-1 and anti-LKM-3 autoantibodies are also detected in some patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and chronic hepatitis D (HDV). Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) has been documented as the major target-autoantigen of anti-LKM-1 autoantibodies in both AIH-2 and HCV infection. Recent convincing data demonstrated the expression of CYP2D6 on the surface of hepatocytes suggesting a pathogenetic role of anti-LKM-1 autoantibodies for the liver damage. Family 1 of UDP-glycuronosyltransferases has been identified as the target-autoantigen of anti-LKM-3. For these reasons the distinction between AIH and chronic viral hepatitis (especially of HCV) is of particular importance. Recently, the molecular target of anti-SLA/LP and anti-LC1 autoantibodies were identified as a 50 kDa UGA-suppressor tRNA-associated protein and a liver specific enzyme, the formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase, respectively. Anti-ASGP-R and anti-LC1 autoantibodies appear to correlate closely with disease severity and response to treatment suggesting a pathogenetic role of these autoantibodies for the hepatocellular injury. In general however, autoantibodies should not be used to monitor treatment, predict AIH activity or outcome. Finally, the current aspects on a specific form of AIH that may develop in some patients with a rare genetic syndrome, the autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome (APECED) are also given. Autoantibodies against liver microsomes (anti-LM) are the specific autoantibodies detected in AIH as a disease component of APECED but also in cases of dihydralazine-induced hepatitis. Cytochrome P450 1A2 has been identified as the target-autoantigen of anti-LM autoantibodies in both APECED-related AIH and dihydralazine-induced hepatitis. The latter may indicate that similar autoimmune pathogenetic mechanisms can lead to liver injury in susceptible individuals irrespective of the primary defect. Characterization of the autoantigen-autoantibody repertoire continues to be an attractive and important tool to get access to the correct diagnosis and to gain insight into the as yet unresolved mystery of how hepatic tolerance is given up and AIH ensues.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To determine the readmission rate, its reasons, predictors, and cost of 30-d readmission in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the nationwide readmission database (NRD) was performed during the calendar year 2013. All adults cirrhotics with a diagnosis of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or hepatic encephalopathy were identified by ICD-9 codes. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess predictors of 30-d readmission and cost of readmission. Results: Of the 59597 patients included in this study, 18319 (31%) were readmitted within 30 d. Majority (58%) of readmissions were for liver related reasons. Paracentesis was performed in 29832 (50%) patients on index admission. Independent predictors of 30-d readmission included age < 40 (OR: 1.39; CI: 1.19-1.64), age 40-64 (OR: 1.19; CI: 1.09-1.30), Medicaid (OR: 1.21; CI: 1.04-1.41) and Medicare coverage (OR: 1.13; CI: 1.02-1.26), > 3 Elixhauser comorbidity (OR: 1.13; CI: 1.05-1.22), nonalcoholic cirrhosis (OR: 1.16; CI: 1.10-1.23), paracentesis on index admission (OR: 1.28; CI: 1.21-1.36) and having hepatocellular carcinoma (OR: 1.21; CI: 1.05; 1.39). Cost of index admission was similar in patients readmitted and not readmitted (P-value: 0.34); however cost of care was significantly more on 30 d readmission ($30959 ± 762) as compared to index admission ($12403 ± 378), P-value: < 0.001. Conclusion: Cirrhotic patients with ascites have a 33% chance of readmission within 30-d. Younger patients, with public insurance, nonalcoholic cirrhosis and increased comorbidity who underwent paracentesis are at increased risk of readmission. Risk factors for unplanned readmission should be targeted given these patients have higher healthcare utilization.",

    "Abstract": "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare autoimmune disease (incidence about 5% among all chronic liver disorders) that reflects a loss of tolerance to normal hepatic proteins. AIH is characterized by female preponderance, hypergammaglobulinemia, extrahepatic syndromes and a good response to immunosuppressive treatment. AIH may be subdivided into two or three subtypes. AIH type 1 is characterized by antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) and/or smooth muscle antibodies (SMA). SMA are actin-specific, can occur without ANA and their presence relates strongly to AIH. AIH type 2 is defined by the presence of anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM-1). Patients with AIH type 2 are typically younger at the time of disease onset, exhibit higher inflammatory activity, suffer more frequent relapses under immunosuppressive treatment and are more likely to progress to cirrhosis. AIH type 3 is characterized by autoantibodies against the soluble liver antigen (SLA) and liver-pancreas antigen (LP), but ANA/SMA are frequently present and, therefore, some authors consider this autoantibody manifestation as belonging to AIH type 1. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) recognize cytoplasmic or nuclear components of neutrophilic granulocytes and are detected with high prevalence in patients with autoimmune liver diseases. They are associated with AIH type 1 but not with AIH type 2. However, 40-70% of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) also produce these autoantibodies. Autoimmune cholangitis is an idiopathic disorder with mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic findings that typically has antinuclear antibodies (ANA). It may be considered as an atypical form of primary biliary cirrhosis. It has been recognized that some forms of AIH may also occur with variable incidence and severity especially in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (overlap AIH/PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (AIH/PSC). On the basis of clinical, biochemical, serological, histological and radiological criteria a clear distinction between these conditions can be readily made in the majority of cases. An association of AIH-typical autoantibodies (anti-LKM-1, anti-SLA/LP) in association with antimitochondrial autoantibodies (AMA) almost confirm the overlap syndrome AIH/PBC. In PSC patients expressing typical ERCP findings and suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the diagnosis of an overlap syndrome between PSC/AIH can be readily made in the presence of ANCA and AIH relevant autoantibodies. Apart from this kind of overlap syndrome involving different types of autoimmune disorders within the liver AIH can be also associated with other organspecific autoimmune disorders as documented in the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1). In this disease homozygosity for a defect in a single gene (AIRE) leads to a broad spectrum of organ specific autoimmune diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by fatty liver and liver cell injury, advancing to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Diagnosis involves liver biopsy; however, as a result of its high cost and invasiveness, NASH remains underdiagnosed, and accurate burden of disease (BoD) data are lacking. Our aim was to understand the epidemiological and BoD landscape in NASH and identify knowledge gaps. Methods: The Ovid search engine was used to conduct a structured review, following quality systematic principles. It included publications that reported on epidemiology, quality of life (QoL) and BoD outcomes in NASH adults. Searches were limited to English language studies published between January 2007 and September 2017. Additional grey literature searches were conducted. A total of 53 references were selected; 38 were peer-reviewed and 15 were grey literature sources. Results: NASH is estimated to affect 3-5% of the global population, most suffering from several comorbidities. Advancing fibrosis drives clinical outcomes, with approximately 20% of patients developing cirrhosis and/or HCC, the latter being a leading cause of death in NASH. A recent model predicted the 15-year survival of advanced fibrosis patients at F3 and F4 as 51.0% and 28.4%, respectively. The limited data consistently show that NASH patients experience significantly poorer QoL and higher costs compared to non-NASH patients. Conclusion: This first broad-ranging examination of NASH literature revealed a paucity of evidence, with poor-quality, small studies found. The overwhelming impact of NASH and its patient and healthcare burden is evident. Further evidence is needed to improve our understanding of NASH, especially as fibrosis stages advance.

    "Abstract": "Aim: Arg72Pro is a polymorphism commonly occurring in the proline-rich domain of Tp53. It can determine the development of different types of cancers, such as breast, lung, cervical, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma. Previous studies reported a correlation between Pro72 homozygosity and the clinical course of ulcerative colitis (UC). Our aim was to evaluate Arg72Pro genotype in patients who underwent proctocolectomy with ileo-pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for UC compared with those who did not need surgery. Material of study: The distribution of the different genotype of Arg72Pro was studied in 264 (234 medically treated [MT] and 30 IPAA) patients affected with UC observed between 2008 and 2011. IPAA patients underwent restorative proctocolectomy for refractory UC; MT ones were managed medically. Blood samples for genotyping were collected from all patients. Arg72Pro genotype analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP). Results: In MT patients (n=234) Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro frequencies were 51.28%, 41.02% and 7.7%, respectively, while in IPAA patients (n=30) were 53.4%, 23.3% and 23.3%, respectively. A statistically significant association was found between Pro/Pro and need for surgery (p=<0.0059, χ =7.59). Conclusion: Our results showed that the Pro/Pro genotype was higher in IPAA (23.3%) than in MT (7.7%) patients. In UC patients the proline homozygosity identifies likeliness to resist to any standard pharmacologic therapy. It could potentially identify patients who would benefit from early surgical treatment, thereby reducing the rate of emergency colectomies and complications related to them.

    "Abstract": "Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a disease of unknown aetiology characterised by hypergammaglobulinaemia, non-organ and liver-related autoantibodies, association with HLA-DR3 or DR4 and a favourable response to immunosuppression. The current classification of AIH and the several autoantibodies/target autoantigens found in this disease are reported. The importance of these markers in the differential diagnosis and the study of pathogenesis of AIH is also given. AIH is subdivided into two major types: AIH type 1 (AIH-1) and AIH type 2 (AIH-2). AIH-1 is characterised by the detection of smooth muscle autoantibodies (SMA) and/or antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), in most cases of perinuclear pattern (p-ANCA), by the indirect immunofluorescence assay, antibodies against the asialoglycoprotein receptor (anti-ASGP-R) and antibodies to soluble liver antigens or liver-pancreas (anti-SLA/LP) may be useful for the identification of individuals who are seronegative for ANA/SMA. AIH-2 is characterised by the presence of specific autoantibodies against liver and kidney microsomal antigens (anti-LKM type 1 or infrequently anti-LKM type 3) and/or autoantibodies against liver cytosol 1 antigen (anti-LC1). Anti-LKM-1 and anti-LKM-3 autoantibodies are also detected in some patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and chronic hepatitis D (HDV). For these reasons, the distinction between AIH and chronic viral hepatitis is of particular importance. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is the major target autoantigen of anti-LKM-1 autoantibodies in both conditions (AIH-2 and HCV infection). Recent data have demonstrated the expression of CYP2D6 on the surface of hepatocytes, suggesting a pathogenetic role of anti-LKM-1 autoantibodies in liver injury. Family 1 of UDP-glycuronosyltransferases has been identified as the target autoantigen of anti-LKM-3. The molecular target of anti-SLA/LP autoantibodies has been identified recently as a 50 kDa protein with unknown structure and function. A liver-specific enzyme, the formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase, was identified as the target autoantigen of anti-LC1 autoantibodies. Anti-ASGP-R and anti-LC1 autoantibodies appear to correlate better with the severity of AIH and the response to treatment. The latter may suggest a pathogenic role of these autoantibodies in the hepatocellular damage in AIH. In general, however, autoantibodies should not be used to monitor treatment or to predict AIH activity or outcome. Finally, current knowledge concerning a specific form of AIH that may develop in some patients with a rare genetic syndrome, the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type-1 (APS-1), is also discussed. Autoantibodies against liver microsomes (anti-LM) are the specific autoantibodies found in AIH as a disease component of APS-1. However, anti-LM autoantibodies have also been described in cases of dihydralazine-induced hepatitis. Cytochrome P450 1A2 has been identified as the target autoantigen of anti-LM autoantibodies in both disease entities.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of the study: The aim of the study was to evaluate the spectrum of AIDS-defining malignancies (ADMs) and non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADMs) in HIV-infected patients in Poland. Material and methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted among HIV-infected adult patients who developed a malignancy between 1995 and 2012 in a Polish cohort. Malignancies were divided into ADMs and NADMs. Non-AIDS-defining malignancies were further categorised as virus-related (NADMs-VR) and unrelated (NADMs-VUR). Epidemiological data was analysed according to demographic data, medical history, and HIV-related information. Results were analysed by OR, EPITools package parameters and Fisher's exact test. Results: In this study 288 malignancies were discovered. The mean age at diagnosis was 41.25 years (IQR20-81); for ADMs 38.05 years, and for NADMs-VURs 46.42 years; 72.22% were male, 40.28% were co-infected with HCV. The risk behaviours were: 37.85% IDU, 33.33% MSM, and 24.31% heterosexual. Mean CD4+ at the diagnosis was 282 cells/mm(3) (for ADMs 232 and for NADMs-VUR 395). Average duration of HIV infection at diagnosis was 5.69 years. There were 159 (55.2%) ADMs and 129 (44.8%) NADMs, among whom 58 (44.96%) NADMs-VR and 71 (55.04%) NADMs-VUR. The most frequent malignancies were: NHL (n = 76; 26.39%), KS (n = 49; 17.01%), ICC (n = 34; 11.81%), HD (n = 23; 7.99%), lung cancer (n = 18; 6.25%) and HCC (n = 14; 4.86%). The amount of NADMs, NADMs-VURs in particular, is increasing at present. Male gender (OR = 1.889; 95% CI: 1.104-3.233; p = 0.024), advanced age: 50-60 years (OR = 3.022; 95% CI: 1.359-6.720; p = 0.01) and ≥ 60 years (OR = 15.111; 95% CI: 3.122-73.151; p < 0.001), longer duration of HIV-infection and successful HAART (OR = 2.769; 95% CI: 1.675-4.577; p = 0) were independent predictors of NADMs overall, respectively. Conclusions: In a Polish cohort NHL was the most frequent malignancy among ADMs, whereas HD was the most frequent among NADMs. Increased incidence of NADMs appearing in elderly men with longer duration of HIV-infection and with better virological and immunological control was confirmed. As HIV-infected individuals live longer, better screening strategies, especially for NADMs-VUR, are needed. The spectrum of cancer diagnoses in Poland currently does not appear dissimilar to that observed in other European populations.",

    "Abstract": "Background: With the development of imaging technology, an increasing number of subcentimeter hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been detected. How to manage these lesions remains controversial and lacks evidence. We aimed to explore whether timely treating subcentimeter HCC is necessary considering the risks of false-positives and treatment failure. Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed HCC patients treated with hepatectomy or ablation in our institution. Then, we enrolled 439 HCC patients with solitary lesion measuring up to 2 cm from November 1, 2009 to June 30, 2019. The baseline and clinical characteristics of these patients were collected. The patients were classified into primary and recurrent groups. The Kaplan-Meier method with Log-rank test was performed to compare the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with subcentimeter HCC and those with HCC measuring 1-2 cm. Univariate and multivariate analyses were adopted to identify prognostic factors for survival. Results: The OS and RFS did not differ significantly between patients with subcentimeter HCC and those with HCC measuring 1-2 cm in the primary group (p = 0.12 and 0.75). Similar results were found in the recurrent group. In multivariate analysis, the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade and serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level were significantly associated with OS and RFS in the primary group. The serum AFP level was the only factor that correlated with OS and RFS in the recurrent group. Conclusion: Routine screening for subcentimeter HCC is feasible. Considering uncertain diagnosis and treatment difficulties, it is more considerable to follow patients until lesions are larger than 1 cm and then provide curative treatments.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complication of chronic hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infection. New York City (NYC) has a high prevalence of HBV and HCV, and infected persons likely face increased mortality from HCC and other causes. We describe the mortality profile of NYC residents with HBV or HCV, emphasizing the contributions of HCC and HIV coinfection. Methods: Two existing data sets were combined to examine all individuals diagnosed with HBV or HCV in NYC first reported to the Health Department during 2001-2012 and their HCC, HIV, and vital status. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of HCC diagnosis by viral hepatitis status, whereas Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard of death by HCC/HIV status. Results: In total, 120 952 and 127 933 individuals were diagnosed with HBV or HCV, respectively. HCV-infected individuals had 17% higher odds of HCC diagnosis than HBV-infected individuals and 3.2 times higher odds of HIV coinfection. Those with HCV were twice as likely to die during the study period (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.96-2.12). The risk of death increased for those with HIV or HCC and was highest for those with both conditions. Conclusions: HCC and HIV represent substantial risks to survival for both HBV- and HCV-infected individuals. Individuals with HBV need close monitoring and treatment, when indicated, and routine HCC screening. Those with HCV need increased, timely access to curative medications before developing liver disease.",

We hypothesized that a two-week interval between TACE and RT would be optimal. Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of scheduled interval TACE followed by RT. HCC patients who were not eligible for standard therapies were enrolled for scheduled interval TACE followed by RT (START). Patients received TACE on the first day of treatment, and then RT was delivered after 14 days. The entire course of treatment took between four and five weeks. In 81 patients (96.4%), START was completed in the planned treatment period. RT was delayed in the remaining three patients because of decreased liver function or poor performance status after TACE. Of the 81 patients, objective response was observed in 57 patients (70.4%). One unexpected death occurred after START due to hepatic failure. Other toxicities were manageable. The median survival was 14.7 months. There was a significant difference in overall survival according to the response to START (P < 0.001). In conclusion, START is safe and feasible.",

    "Abstract": "Germline mutations of the LKB1 gene are associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which is characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation and gastrointestinal hamartoma with an increased risk of cancer development. To investigate the role of LKB1 in vivo, we have recently constructed Lkb1 gene knockout mice. Because of Lkb1 gene haploinsufficiency, the heterozygous Lkb1 mice develop gastrointestinal polyps of which the histological characteristics resemble those of the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome hamartomas. Here we demonstrate that the Lkb1 (+/-) mice develop hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). In Lkb1 (+/-) mice >50 weeks of age, >70% of the male mice developed HCCs, whereas only 20% of the females had HCCs, showing a sex difference in the susceptibility. Histological examinations revealed various types of HCCs, such as \"trabecular,\" \"clear cell,\" \"pseudoglandular,\" and \"sarcomatous\" types, which were strikingly similar to those found in human HCCs. Western blotting and PCR analyses showed loss of Lkb1 heterozygosity in all of the HCC tissues examined, indicating a tumor suppressor role of LKB1 in the mouse liver. These results suggest that lack of LKB1 is a novel mechanism for HCC development. Thus, the Lkb1 (+/-) knockout mutant should be an important and useful model for human HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have revolutionized the therapy of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and have replaced previous PEG-interferon/ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) treatment. Patients with CHC and advanced liver disease are at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the effects of DAA-based CHC treatment on subsequent HCC incidence remain poorly understood. Patients and methods: This retrospective single-institution cohort study included 243 consecutive patients after PEG-IFN/RBV and 263 patients after DAA treatment. Multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare time to HCC between treatment types, censoring patients who died or had an orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) at the time of the competing event. Age, gender, BMI, viral load, cirrhosis, fibrosis stage, diabetes, virus genotype and previous PEG-IFN/RBV (before DAA) were used as covariates. In addition, we performed a propensity score-matched analysis. Results: Nineteen HCC cases were observed after DAA therapy compared to 18 cases after PEG-IFN/RBV treatment. Patients were followed for a median of 4.1 years (IQR: 3.5-4.7) for DAA and 9.3 years (IQR: 6.6-12.4) for the PEG-IFN/RBV group. In an unadjusted Cox model, a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.40 (CI: 2.20-18.61, p=0.006) for HCC following DAA vs PEG-IFN/RBV was estimated. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, age and liver cirrhosis were identified as further HCC risk factors but the HR estimates for DAA vs PEG-IFN/RBV still indicate a considerably increased hazard associated with DAA treatment (HR between 7.23 and 11.52, p≤0.001, depending on covariates). A HR of 6.62 (CI: 2.01-21.84, p=0.002) for DAA vs PEG-IFN/RBV was estimated in the propensity score-matched analysis. The secondary outcomes death and OLT did not differ between treatment groups. Conclusion: In a cohort study from a tertiary care hospital rates of HCC after the start of DAA treatment were higher compared to PEG-IFN/RBV treatment. Our data reinforce the recommendation that surveillance should be continued after successful CHC treatment.",

    "Abstract": "The role of microsatellite instability (MSI) in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is incompletely defined. Although high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) is infrequently seen in HCC, some studies have suggested a role for MSI in HCC development. While MSI has been clearly defined for a subset of tumors, in particular colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancers, generally accepted criteria have not been developed for other tumors. Colorectal cancers (CRC) are classified as MSI-H if >30-40% of >5 microsatellite loci analyzed show instability. The MSI-H phenotype is associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and is observed in the majority of tumors from patients with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) and also in 15% of sporadic CRCs. Inactivating mutations of the hMLH1 or hMSH2 genes lead to defects in MMR in HNPCC. In sporadic CRCs, MMR is usually due to hypermethylation of the hMLH-1 promoter. The role of defective MMR in hepatocellular carcinogenesis is controversial. Immunohistochemistry for hMLH1 and hMSH2 reliably indicates hMLH1 or hMSH2 loss in MSI-H CRC tumors. To investigate the role of defective MMR in HCC carcinogenesis, we performed immunohistochemistry for hMLH1 and hMSH2 on 36 HCCs. BAT26, a microsatellite marker that reliably predicts MSI-H was also examined. All 36 of the tumors stained positively for both hMLH1 and hMSH2, strongly suggesting an absence of either inactivating mutations of hMLH1 and hMSH2 or promoter hypermethylation of hMLH1. None of the tumors showed MSI at the BAT26 locus. These findings suggest that defective MMR does not contribute significantly to hepatocellular carcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Rationale: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases to the zygomatic bone are extremely uncommon, and the treatment of target drugs against such case is unknown. Patient concerns: A 48-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital under suspicion of an advanced liver tumor due to an increase in levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) after radiofrequency ablation for independent nodule in his liver 1 month before. He had a hepatitis B virus (HBV) history for 20 years without treatment. Diagnosis and interventions: A diagnosis of primary HCC was made based on pathological examination following right hepatectomy. Seven months after the surgery, a mass in S8 was identified and treated by ARF. Twenty days later, a right zygomatic mass was observed and the incisional biopsy revealed metastasis from HCC. Due to side effects of chemotherapy, the metastatic zygomatic mass was treated with radioactive seed implantation. Despite these interventions, there was steady increase in AFP values as well as increase in size of the zygomatic mass. Hence, the patient was started on apatinib with a dose of 500 mg/day from 1 to 28 days per cycle for a duration of 10 months. Outcomes: The AFP values were significantly decreased but the size of the zygomatic mass continued to increase indicating progression of disease. But the progression-free survival was more than 10 months. The patient exhibited adverse reactions which were controllable by symptomatic treatments. As of last follow-up, the patient is unwell with pain in the face, blurred vision in the right eye, dyscrasia, and exhibited difficulty in opening his mouth. Lessons: HCC metastases to the zygomatic bone are very aggressive with a very low incidence and immunohistochemistry is useful diagnostic indicators. Still now, there is no optimal treatment strategy for these patients. Apatinib may be a promising drug in the treatment of HCC metastases to the zygomatic bone.",

In the present study, the association between loss of 17p and TP53 mutation was analyzed in 94 primary HCC of Chinese patients. Loss of one allele at 17p13.3 distal to the TP53 gene was observed in 48 of 94 HCC (51%), whereas loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 17p13.1 near the TP53 gene was detected in 30 of 94 HCC (32%) and TP53 mutation was detected in only 22 of 94 HCC (23%). High frequency of LOH at 17p13.3 and relatively low frequency of TP53 mutation in the present study indicate that loss of function of a putative tumor suppressor gene at 17p13.3 may play a more important role than TP53 in HCC development.",

    "Abstract": "Epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes has been observed in various cancers. Looking at hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specific protein silencing was previously demonstrated to be associated with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, the proposed HCV dependent promoter methylation of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and thereby enhanced progression of hepatocarcinogenesis has been the subject of controversial discussion. We investigated promoter methylation pattern of the MMR genes MLH1, MSH2 and PMS2 as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene (p16) in 61 well characterized patients with HCCs associated with HCV, Hepatitis B virus infection or alcoholic liver disease. DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour and non-tumour adjacent tissue and analysed by methylation-specific PCR. Moreover, microsatellite analysis was performed in tissues showing methylation in MMR gene promoters. Our data demonstrated that promoter methylation of MLH1, MSH2, PMS2 and p16 is present among all considered HCCs. Hereby, promoter silencing was detectable more frequently in advanced-stage HCCs than in low-stage ones. However, there was no significant correlation between aberrant DNA methylation of MMR genes or p16 and HCV infection in related HCC specimens. In summary, we show that promoter methylation of essential MMR genes and p16 is detectable in HCCs most dominantly in pT3 stage tumour cases. Since loss of MMR proteins was previously described to be not only responsible for tumour development but also for chemotherapy resistance, the knowledge of mechanisms jointly responsible for HCC progression might enable significant improvement of individual HCC therapy in the future.",

    "Abstract": "Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation promotes tumors in several endodermally derived tissues, but its role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. Although normal hepatocytes lack Hh signaling, activation of the Hh pathway in endodermal progenitors is required for liver development. Thus, we hypothesized that hepatocarcinogenesis may involve regulation of Hh signaling. This pathway is activated when Hh ligand binds to its receptor, Patched (PTC). In an unoccupied state, PTC normally functions as a tumor suppressor that inhibits Smoothened (SMO), a proto-oncoprotein, from activating downstream components and transcription of target genes. Here we show that in HCCs, overexpression of the Smo proto-oncogene, as well as an increase in the stoichiometric ratio of Smo to Ptc mRNA levels, correlated with tumor size, a prognostic indicator in HCC biology. In one tumor we identified a novel Smo mutation in an evolutionarily conserved residue. We also demonstrated that HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) expressed Hh pathway components and activated Hh transcriptional targets. In Hep3B cells, cyclopamine, an inhibitor of wild-type SMO, had no effect, but KAAD-cyclopamine, a blocker of oncogenic SMO, inhibited Hh signaling activity by 50%, decreased expression of the hepatocarcinogenic oncogene, c-myc, by 8-fold, and inhibited the growth rate of Hep3B cells by 94%. These data support our hypothesis that Hh signaling is dysregulated in human hepatocarcinogenesis. We demonstrate that overexpression and/or tumorigenic activation of the Smo proto-oncogene mediates c-myc overexpression which plays a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis and suggests that Smo is a prognostic factor in HCC tumorigenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is widely performed for patients to resolve the critical shortage of organs from cadavers. Despite rapid implementation of the procedure, both complications and mortality of LDLT are annoying problems. The aim of this study was to analyze complications and mortality of patients after adult to adult LDLT (A-ALDLT) in a single center. Methods: Between April 2003 and November 2013, 167 (A-ALDLT) recipients in National Liver Institute, Egypt were included. We retrospectively analyzed complications and mortality in them. Results: The overall incidence of complications was 86.2% (n = 144) and classified as biliary 43.7% (n = 73), vascular 21.6% (n = 36), Small for size syndrome (SFSS) 12.6% (n = 21), Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) 19.8% (n = 33), wound 12.6% (n = 21), chest 19.8% (n = 33), neurological 26.3% (n = 44), renal 21% (n = 35), intra abdominal collection 21.6% (n = 36), recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) 16.8% (n = 28), recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 2.4% (n = 4), acute rejection 19.2% (n = 32). 65 (45.1%) of 144 complicated patients died, while 10 (43.5%) of 23 non complicated died. The incidence of whole, in hospital and late mortalities were 44.9%, 28.7% and 16.2% respectively. Conclusions: Mortality was higher among complicated cases where vascular complications and SFSS had significant effect on it so prevention and treatment of them is required for improving outcome.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the interaction between tumor-infiltrating macrophages and cancer cells and its effect on the expression of a potent angiogenic factor, interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor angiogenesis, and patient outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Experimental design: We measured tumor IL-8 mRNA expression (by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR), intratumor microvessel counts, and tumor-infiltrating macrophage density (by immunohistochemical staining) in 35 NSCLC surgical specimens and correlated with the patient's clinical outcome. We then investigated the interaction between macrophages (cell line THP-1) and six different human cancer cell lines (four NSCLCs, one osteosarcoma, and one hepatoma) and its effect on IL-8 mRNA expression using a macrophage/cancer cell coculture system, IL-8 mRNA expression in lung cancer cells, and macrophages being measured separately after coculture in the presence or absence of six anti-inflammatory agents, i.e., pentoxifylline, aspirin, indomethacin, dexamethasone, celecoxib (a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor), and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a specific nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and protein levels were measured by reporter gene assay and Western blot. Results: The tumor-infiltrating macrophage density correlated significantly and positively with tumor IL-8 mRNA expression and intratumor microvessel counts and significantly and negatively with patient survival. In addition, after cell-cell interaction in cancer cell:macrophage cocultures, marked IL-8 mRNA expression was induced in lung cancer cells (approximately 270-fold) and, to a lesser degree, in macrophages (4.5-fold). The increase in IL-8 mRNA expression correlated with the in vitro metastatic potential of the cancer cells. All six anti-inflammatory agents suppressed induction of IL-8 mRNA expression in lung cancer cells by >90%, four (pentoxifylline, celecoxib, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and dexamethasone) having a dose-dependent effect. NF-kappaB transcriptional regulation and protein levels were simultaneously increased in the nuclei of cancer cells in macrophage/cancer cell cocultures, this effect also being suppressed by all six anti-inflammatory agents. Conclusions: The interaction between infiltrating macrophages and cancer cells up-regulates IL-8 mRNA expression, especially in the cancer cells; this may contribute greatly to the increased tumor angiogenesis and adverse outcome in NSCLC patients with a high density of tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Anti-inflammatory agents can suppress the induction of IL-8 mRNA expression seen in lung cancer cells after coculture with macrophages, and this suppression is mediated, in part, through the NF-kappaB pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activates the VEGF-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signaling pathway in angiogenesis. Some cancer cell lines show decreased expression of the two VEGFRs, Flt-1 and KDR, even though VEGF is uniformly expressed in cancer cell lines. Promoter methylation is a well-known cause of epigenetic gene silencing in cancer cells. Although VEGF, Flt-1 and KDR have typical CpG islands in their promoter regions, the epigenetic transcriptional alterations of these genes have not yet been described. The present study evaluated the epigenetic gene silencing of VEGF and VEGFR genes in cancer tissues. We also analyzed whether the epigenetic alterations of VEGFR genes influence VEGFR expression concurrently with VEGF activation in cancer tissues. All cancer tissues we tested showed no methylation of VEGF, and variable promoter hypermethylation of Flt-1 and KDR. The promoter hypermethylation of Flt-1 and KDR was correlated with decreasing expression of the respective genes. In contrast, an increase in VEGF expression was positively correlated with Flt-1 and KDR expression in primary cancer tissues. The opposing influences of promoter methylation of VEGFR and increased VEGF expression concurrently influence Flt-1 and KDR expression in stomach cancer, colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. The findings we observed showed that the epigenetic alteration developing in VEGFR genes might be an important factor to concurrently modulate expressions of the genes in addition to VEGF stimulation in cancer tissues. The epigenetic silencing of VEGFR genes should be considered in the activation of VEGF-VEGFR signaling pathway in the cancer cells.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To explore the effect of two dominating signaling pathways, VEGF/KDR and angiopoietins/Tie2, on the formation of new blood vessel in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and metastasis. Methods: RT-PCR and Western blot were employed to evaluate the VEGF/KDR and angiopoietins/Tie2 expression in samples from 23 patients with HCC. Meanwhile, microvessel density (MVD) was determined as a marker of angiogenesis by counting CD34 positive cells with the method of immunohistochemistry. Results: The two pathways were activated in all HCC samples. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) were significantly higher (P<0.05) in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and the margin of the tumor than those in control groups, and so did CD34 positive cells. Although significant difference in the expression of kinase insert domain containing receptor (KDR) and Ang1/Tie2 was not observed in all groups, their distinct high levels were seen in hepatoma and its margin compared with normal and cirrhotic liver. VEGF and Ang2 expressions were seen up-regulated in HCC with vascular invasion and satellite lesion. Conclusions: The two signaling pathways, VEGF/KDR and angiopoietins/Tie2 are activated in the process of angiogenesis in HCC and modulate the formation of new blood vessels. The imparity of the two signaling pathways' activation is to benefit HCC metastasis. In the two pathways, VEGF and Ang2 may play an important role in the process of angiogenesis, and are necessary indicators for the prognosis and metastasis of HCC. This study provides another clue for the exploration of anti-angiogenic agents.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/AKT pathway plays a pivotal role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutant PIK3CA, encoding the p110a catalytic subunit, stimulates the AKT pathway and promotes cell growth in various cancers. PIK3CA mutation rate has been usually reported as low frequency (<5%) in HCC except one report from Korea with 35.6%. Therefore, we investigated the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in Korean HCC patients. Materials and methods: We sequenced exons1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19 and 20 of PIK3CA in 268 HCC tumor tissue samples by Sanger method and pyrosequencing assay. Results: In this study, the mutations were not detected in exons3, 6, 8, and 19, and detected 1 at unknown SNP in exon1 and exon4, 2 at unknown SNP in exon7, 2 at unknown SNP in exon20. However, 1 at unknown SNP, 1 at G1635T and surprisingly all samples at A1634Cin exon9 were detected by Sanger method. Additional experiments with normal tissue, cloning experiments and a pyrosequencing assay revealed that the double peak at A1634C of exon9 is a pseudogene, not true mutation. The mutations found in this study were all different and small numbers, therefore, we cannot conclude specific relationship between clinical characteristics of HCC and mutation of PIK3CA. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the rate of PIK3CA mutation in the Korea population is in fact similar to the rates seen elsewhere in the world.",

Methods: The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used, covering 10.2 million individuals for the years 1961-1998 from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Liver and biliary tract cancers were identified from 1121 offspring between the ages of 0 and 66 years and 17 131 parents. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for cancers in family members. Results: All cancers in the liver and biliary system showed a familial SIR of 1.65 (95% CI 1.05-2.46). This was mainly explained by a high risk for familial gall bladder cancer (SIR 5.21 (95% CI 2.07-10.80)) and for familial primary liver cancer with hepatocellular carcinoma histology (SIR 4.69 (95% CI 1.48-11.04)). For gall bladder and hepatocellular cancer, maternal transmission appeared to be favoured. Gall bladder cancer was associated with pancreatic cancer (SIR 2.39 (95% CI 1.23-4.18)). Primary liver cancer was associated with cervical, urinary bladder, and endocrine gland tumours. Cancer in extrahepatic bile ducts was associated with ovarian cancer and that in ampulla of Vater with thyroid cancer; however, these associations may have been fortuitous. Conclusions: This study has provided the first data on familial clustering of liver and gall bladder cancers, based on medically confirmed records. The risks were so high that heritable factors were likely to contribute, possibly modified by environmental factors. The demonstration of candidate genes would help to further characterise the familial risks.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: To evaluate the role of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as an ablative technique in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Settings and design: A tertiary care center, prospective study. Materials and methods: The subjects comprised 31 patients (30 males, one female; age range 32-75 years) with HCC (41 lesions) who were treated with image-guided RFA. The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 6 years, and included a multiphasic computed tomography (CT) at 1, 3 and 6 months post-RFA, and every 6 months thereafter. Patient outcome was evaluated and the tumor recurrence, survival and complications were assessed. Statistical analysis used: Discrete categorical data were presented as n (%) and continuous data as mean ± SD. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between the different variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Log-rank test were used to test the significance of difference between the survival time of the different groups. Results: The ablation success rate was 80.5% (33/41 HCC lesions). 12.2% (5/41) of the lesions were managed with repeat RFA due to tumor residue. 4.9% (2/41) of the lesions were managed with repeated RFA and transarterial chemoembolization. Eight patients had tumor recurrence (five patients (16.1%) had local recurrence and three patients (9.6%) had distant recurrence). Eleven patients died within 3.5-20 months post-RFA. The survival rate at 1 year in patients who completed at least 1 year of follow-up was 63.3%. There was one major complication (1/31, 3.2%) in a patient with a subcapsular lesion and ascites. This patient developed hemoperitoneum in the immediate postprocedure period and was managed with endovascular treatment. She, however, had hepatic decompensation and died 48 h post-RFA. Conclusion: RFA is an effective and safe treatment for small unresectable HCC.",

Materials and methods: The anti-human death receptor 5 single-chain antibody was constructed and expressed. Protein-loaded hydroxyethyl chitosan nanoparticles were prepared, and their size, morphology, particle-size distribution and surface zeta potential were measured by scanning electron microscopy and laser particle-size analysis. Mouse H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were cultured, and growth inhibition was examined using the CellTiter-Blue cell-viability assay. Flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 were employed to measure cell apoptosis. Kunming mice with H22 tumor models were treated with protein-loaded hydroxyethyl chitosan nanoparticles, and their body weight and tumor size were measured, while hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to detect antitumor effects in vivo and side effects from tumors. Results: The protein-loaded hydroxyethyl chitosan nanoparticles had good stability; the zeta potential was -24.2±0.205, and the dispersion index was 0.203. The inhibition of the protein-loaded hydroxyethyl chitosan nanoparticles on H22 growth was both time- and dose-dependent. Increased expressions of active caspase 8, active caspase 3, and BAX were detected following treatment. The average weight gain, tumor weight, and mean tumor volume of the protein and protein-loaded hydroxyethyl chitosan nanoparticle groups were significantly different (P<0.05) compared with the phosphate-buffered saline group. Conclusion: The protein-loaded hydroxyethyl chitosan nanoparticles effectively suppressed tumor growth, indicating that nanotechnology has the potential for broad application in cancer therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Schisandrin B (Sch B) a main active component of Schisandra chinensis, has been shown to act as a liver protectant via activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether its reactive metabolite is responsible for Nrf2 activation; also, the effects of its reactive metabolite on liver function are still unknown. Methods: The present study determined and identifed the carbene reactive metabolite of Sch B in human and mice liver microsomes. Its roles in activating Nrf2 pathway and modifying macromolecules were further explored in human liver microsomes. Moreover the potential cytotoxicity and hepatoxicity of carbene on HepG-2 and mice were also investigated. Results: In the present study, cytochromes P450 (CYP450s) metabolized Sch B to carbene reactive metabolite, which, with the potential to modify peptides, were identifed and observed in human and mice liver microsomes. Moreover, the relevance of carbene in Nrf2 activation was verifed by co-incubation in the presence of CYP450 inhibitors in HepG-2 cells, as well as by molecular docking study of carbene and Keap1. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of Sch B on HepG-2 cells was signifcantly aggravated by CYP450 inducer (with LD50 decreasing from 63 to 21 µM) and signifcantly alleviated by CYP450 inhibitor and glutathione (with LD50 increasing from 63 µM to 200 µM). Besides, after oral administration of mice with Sch B (25-100 mg/kg) for 21 days, only the highest dose induced mild hepatotoxicity, which was accompanied by increasing the aminotransferase activity and centrilobular hepatocellular infltration of lymphocytes. In addition, upregulation of CYP450 activity; Nrf2, NQO-1, and GST expression; and glutathione level was observed in Sch B treatment groups. Conclusion: The present study revealed that CYP450s mediate the conversion of Sch B to carbene, which subsequently binds to Keap1 and elicits Nrf2 pathway, which could further increase the elimination of carbene and thus exhibit a less harmful effect on mice liver.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Despite similarities with BRCA-mutated breast cancers, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) remain resistant to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors as single agents. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can decrease expression of proteins involved in DNA repair. We thus hypothesized that a HDACi (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or belinostat) could sensitize TNBC to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Methods: Human TNBC cells were co-treated with olaparib and either SAHA or belinostat, and their effects on survival, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair pathways were evaluated. Subcutaneous xenografts were used to determine the effect of the combination treatment in vivo. Results: HDACi and olaparib synergistically inhibited proliferation of a panel of 8 TNBC cell lines in vitro and in nude mice harboring TNBC xenografts in vivo. We noted a weaker synergism in PTEN-deficient TNBC cells and a stronger synergism in BRCA1-mutated TNBC cells. In the BRCA1-mutated cell line HCC-1937, we observed a drastic decrease in the expression of proteins involved in homologous recombination (HR), leading to a large imbalance of the ratio P-H2AX/RAD51. In BRCA1 wild type (wt) cell lines, effect of the combination treatment relied on DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest followed by induction of apoptosis. Conclusion: In summary, these results provide a preclinical rationale to combine a HDACi with a PARP inhibitor to reduce HR efficiency in TNBC and sensitize these aggressive tumors to PARP inhibition.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Primary hepatic lymphoma is a rare malignancy which misdiagnosis and mistreatment is very frequent. Differential diagnosis of the hepatic lesion, based on the noninvolvement of blood vessels, includes: fatty infiltration, cirrhosis, amyloid infiltration, primary hepatomas, and metastatic neoplasms. Presentation of case: We describe a case of a 69-year-old man who presented with 15% weight loss and general fatigue over the previous 9 months. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly without lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 13cm×9cm×11cm tumor on the right liver associated with normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). After two negatives ultrasonography-guided needle liver biopsies, the third one showed diffuse infiltration of large sized lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemical findings demonstrated the B-lymphocyte lineage of the tumor. The patient received R-CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab) with good response. Discussion: It is important to recognize PHL because it responds favorably to chemotherapy and may have a better prognosis than hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic disease of the liver. When imaging findings on CT scans and MRI are nonspecific, a biopsy is needed not only for a definitive diagnosis but also for identifying the immunophenotype of the PHL. This type of lesion is highly chemosensitive and early aggressive chemotherapy may result in sustained remission. Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of effective recognition of PHL considering its good response to chemotherapy and the possibility of sustained remission if early aggressive treatment is implemented.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Low-level viremia (LLV) after nucleos(t)ide analog treatment was presented as a possible cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, detailed information on patients' adherence in the real world was lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of LLV on HCC development, mortality, and cirrhotic complications among patients according to their adherence to entecavir (ETV) treatment. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational analysis of data from 894 consecutive adult patients with treatment-naïve CHB undergoing ETV treatment. LLV was defined according to either persistent or intermittent episodes of <2,000 IU/mL detectable hepatitis B virus DNA during the follow-up period. Good adherence to medication was defined as a cumulative adherence ≥90% per study period. Results: Without considering adherence in the entire cohort (n=894), multivariate analysis of the HCC incidence showed that LLV was an independent prognostic factor in addition to other traditional risk factors in the entire cohort (P=0.031). Good adherence group comprised 617 patients (69.0%). No significant difference was found between maintained virologic response and LLV groups in terms of the incidence of liver-related death or transplantation, HCC, and hepatic decompensation in good adherence group, according to multivariate analyses. Conclusion: In patients with treatment-naïve CHB and good adherence to ETV treatment in the real world, LLV during treatment is not a predictive factor for HCC and cirrhotic complications. It may be unnecessary to adjust their antiviral agent for patients with good adherence who experience LLV during ETV treatment.",

    "Abstract": "CYP1A2 polymorphism has been well studied in white persons and Asians but not in Africans. We performed CYP1A2 genotype and phenotype analysis using caffeine in Ethiopians living in Ethiopia (n = 100) or in Sweden (n = 73). We sequenced the CYP1A2 gene using genomic DNA from 12 subjects, which revealed a novel intron 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), -730C>T. We developed SNP-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping and molecular haplotyping methods for the intron 1 SNPs, and four different haplotypes were identified: CYP1A2*1A (wild-type for all SNPs), CYP1A2*1F (-164A), CYP1A2*1J (-740G and -164A), and CYP1A2*1K (-730T, -740G, and -164A), having frequencies of 39.9, 49.6, 7.5, and 3.0%, respectively. The frequency of CYP1A2*1J and CYP1A2*1K among Saudi Arabians (n = 136) was 5.9% and 3.6%, and among Spaniards (n = 117) 1.3% and 0.5%, respectively. Functional significance of the different intron 1 haplotypes was analyzed. Subjects with CYP1A2*1K had significantly decreased CYP1A2 activity in vivo, and reporter constructs with this haplotype had significantly less inducibility with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in human B16A2 hepatoma cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from B16A2 cells revealed a specific DNA binding protein complex to an Ets element. Efficient competition was obtained using oligonucleotide probes carrying the wt sequence and Ets consensus probe, whereas competition was abolished using probes with the -730C>T SNP alone or in combination with -740T>G (CYP1A2*1K). The results indicate a novel polymorphism in intron 1 of importance for Ets-dependent CYP1A2 expression in vivo and inducibility of the enzyme, which might be of critical importance for determination of interindividual differences in drug metabolism and sensitivity to carcinogens activated by CYP1A2.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Globally, it is estimated that 71 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C, and 10-20% of these will develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The development of new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs has contributed to sustained virological response (SVR), eliminating the infection and achieving cure of chronic hepatitis C. However, treated patients can develop HCV resistance to DAAs, which can contribute to the failure of treatment. Here, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and specific pattern of NS5A and NS5B resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) in samples from patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 3a at a public health laboratory, Instituto Adolfo Lutz, São Paulo, Brazil. Patients and methods: Serum samples from the enrolled individuals were submitted to \"in-house\" polymerase chain reaction amplification of NS5A and NS5B non-structural protein genes, which were then sequenced by Sanger method. Results: A total of 170 and 190 samples were amplified and analyzed for NS5A and NS5B, respectively. For NS5A, 20 (12.0%) samples showed some important RAS; 16 (9.0%) showed some type of substitution and 134 (79.0%) showed no polymorphism. No sample showed any RAS for NS5B. Conclusion: This study found important RAS in samples from naïve chronic HCV patients in some areas from São Paulo. The most prevalent were A62S, A30K, and Y93H, which could indicate an increase in resistance to some DAAs used in HCV treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the clinical value of p53 codon 72 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and variants of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Methods: DNA and RNA from 51 HCCs and their matching, uninvolved liver tissues were analyzed for p53 mutations, and the methylation and expression of APC variants were determined. Proliferation of each HCC was assessed by Ki67 immunohistochemistry. The results were correlated with the demographic and clinicopathologic features and patient survival. Results: Of 51 HCCs, 12% exhibited missense p53 mutations. SNP analysis of p53 codon 72 demonstrated the highest prevalence of the Arg/Arg (56%) phenotype, followed by Arg/Pro (33%) and Pro/Pro (11%). Four of five cases with the Pro/Pro phenotype were African Americans (AAs). All five cases with the Pro/Pro phenotype had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, a high Ki67 index, and lower median survival (15.5 months) compared to those with Arg/Arg or Arg/Pro phenotypes (32 months). The overall frequency of APC methylation was 31%, which was found predominantly in Caucasians. There was lower mRNA expression of APC variants-2 and -3 in both HCCs and corresponding adjacent, uninvolved liver tissues as compared to APC variant-1. The expression of APC variant-3, but not variants-1 and -2, was lower in HCCs relative to uninvolved tissues. Expression of all APC variants was lower in HCCs with APC methylation relative to HCCs without APC methylation, and low expression of APC variant-2 was associated with the Pro/Pro phenotype. Conclusions: These findings suggest that, for AA patients with HCCs, the p53 Pro/Pro phenotype and low expression of APC variant-2 are associated with aggressive tumor behavior, HCV infection, and poor clinical outcome.",

    "Abstract": "CYP2E1 is one of the major cytochrome P450 forms whose expression is strongly inhibited by inflammatory cytokines in humans and rodents. In the present study, we have used the Fao rat hepatoma cell line that constitutively expresses CYP2E1 enzyme to investigate mechanisms of cytokine action. The cells were treated with interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), or IL-6 for 24 or 72 h, and the expression of CYP2E1 was monitored at the transcriptional, mRNA, and protein levels. All three cytokines decreased the CYP2E1 mRNA levels after 24 h, and the effect was even stronger after 72 h. In contrast, significant inhibition of CYP2E1 protein was seen only after 72 h. In transfection assays using a CYP2E1 5' -3685 to +29-luciferase construct, it was found that IL-6 inhibited gene transcription after 24 h, but a similar effect by IL-1beta and TNFalpha was registered only after 72 h. Using 5' deletions of the CYP2E1 5'-reporter construct a responsive region for the IL-6 effect was located to -669 to -507 base pairs in the CYP2E1 5'-flanking region. Interestingly, IL-1beta, but not TNFalpha, was found to reduce hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha binding to the CYP2E1 promotor. However, the transactivation function of HNF-1alpha was found to be impaired in Fao cells. In mouse primary hepatocytes, IL-1beta decreased HNF-1alpha-mediated transactivation. In conclusion, our data indicate that inflammatory cytokines inhibit CYP2E1 expression by multiple mechanisms, including control of HNF-1alpha function and regulation of other transcriptional factors acting on the CYP2E1 5'-upstream regulatory region. In addition, regulation of factors of importance for the CYP2E1 mRNA stability may be involved.",

    "Abstract": "Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children. Most children and adolescents are treated with anti-thyroid drugs as the initial modality. Studies have used Methimazole, Carbimazole and Propylthiouracil (PTU) either as titration regimes or as block and replacement regimes. The various studies of anti-thyroid drug (ATD) treatment of Graves' disease in pediatric patients differ in terms of the regimes, remission rate, duration of therapy for adequate remission, follow up and adverse effects of ATD. Various studies show that lower thyroid hormone levels, prolonged duration of treatment, lower levels of TSH receptor antibodies, smaller goiter and increased age of child predicted higher chance of remission after ATD. A variable number of patients experience minor and major adverse effects limiting initial and long term treatment with ATD. The adverse effects of various ATD seem to more in children compared to that of adults. In view of liver injury including hepatocellular failure need of liver transplantation associated with PTU, the use has been restricted in children. The rate of persistent remission with ATD following discontinuation is about 30%. Radioactive iodine therapy is gaining more acceptance in older children with Graves's disease in view of the limitations of ATD. For individual patients, risk-benefit ratio of ATD should be weighed against benefits of radioactive iodine therapy and patient preferences.",

    "Abstract": "The status and the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor A (CDKN2A) family genes, named CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN2C and of cyclin Ds (D1, D2, and D3) genes were investigated in 14 cases of human hepatoblastomas. These genes were selected because: 1) CDKN2A and CDKN2B are very frequently inactivated in human cancers; 2) cyclin Ds are overexpressed in several tumors and 3) CDKN2A is posttranscriptionally silenced in hepatocellular carcinomas. Structural analysis of the CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN2C genes in hepatoblastoma cases showed the absence of deletions and/or point mutations. Moreover, a detailed investigation of loss of heterozygosity at 9p21 and 1p32 (the chromosomal regions where CDKN2A genes are located) rules out the possible loss of one allele. Messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis showed that CDKN2C is expressed in all hepatoblastoma samples studied, while both CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes are not transcribed in the cancer specimens as well as in the matched normal liver tissues. Interestingly, an alternative mRNA expressed by the CDKN2A gene (beta-transcript) is detectable in 100% of the samples investigated. The analysis of cyclin D genes expression revealed that cyclin D1 is highly transcribed in normal hepatic tissue while cyclin D2 or D3 genes were extensively expressed in the matched transformed samples. Investigation at protein level confirmed the data obtained on RNA analysis. Indeed, p16INK4A and p15INK4B (products of expression of CDKN2A and CDKN2B respectively) were not observable while pl8INK4C (which is codified by CDKN2C) was clearly detectable in the samples analyzed. Moreover, a noticeable decrease of cyclin D1 content and increase of cyclin D3 level were observable in tumor tissues versus normal counterparts. Our findings demonstrated the following: 1) CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN2C genes are structurally unmodified in human hepatoblastoma, and 2) CDKN2A (alpha-transcript) and CDKN2B are transcriptionally silenced in normal liver whereas CDKN2A (beta-transcript) and CDKN2C were clearly expressed. Finally, a clear shift in cyclin D type expression was observable during malignant transformation. These results show that CDKN2A gene family alterations are not involved in hepatoblastoma development, whereas changes in cyclin D types might play a role in this type of tumor. Furthermore, a highly regulated expression of CDKN2A seems to occur in normal hepatic tissue.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with macroscopic vascular invasion and distant metastasis is an advanced-stage disease with an extremely poor prognosis and low survival rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to extend the lives of patients with advanced HCC. Case presentation: We represent a case of HCC with macroscopic vascular invasion and pulmonary metastasis responding dramatically to the combination treatment with drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) and Huaier granule. A 64-year-old man with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced liver cirrhosis was diagnosed with advanced HCC involved renal vein and inferior vena cava accompanied by pulmonary metastasis. The patient received three cycles of on-demand DEB-TACE from 9th September 2016 to 22nd August 2017 and combined with Huaier granule 20 g three times a day orally. Eight months following the treatment, complete response occurred with regression of HCC and vascular thrombus and disappearance of pulmonary metastasis. The levels of AFP had decreased from 8165.8ng/mL to within the normal range (1.7 ng/mL). This is the first case report of complete response of HCC to the combination treatment with DEB-TACE and Huaier granule. At the most recent follow-up, he remained in remission 36 months after cessation of treatment without clinical or imaging evidence of disease recurrence. The current overall survival is 54 months since the initial treatment. Conclusion: Data from this clinical case report suggest that the combination treatment with DEB-TACE and Huaier granule is a promising therapeutic option for advanced HCC with macroscopic vascular invasion and distant metastasis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study systematically compared the efficacy and safety of simultaneous hepatectomy and splenectomy (HS) with hepatectomy (H) alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hypersplenism. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched by two independent researchers through to March 31, 2015 to identify relevant studies. All the extracted literature were managed by Bibliographic citation management software. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale judgment. The data were analyzed using RevMan5.2 software. Results: Eight studies including a total of 761 patients with HCC and hypersplenism (360 in the HS group, 401 in the H group) were finally included in the analysis. Outcomes, including postoperative complications, perioperative mortality, operation time, 5-year survival rate, and need for blood transfusion did not differ significantly between the two groups. HS was associated with significantly more intraoperative bleeding (mean difference [MD] 57.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 18.83-95.46, P=0.003), and CD4/CD8 ratio (MD 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.77, P<0.00001), CD4 subset, platelet count (MD 213.06, 95% CI 202.59-223.53, P<0.0001), white blood cell count (MD 4.85, 95% CI 4.58-5.13, P<0.0001), interferon-gamma levels (MD 18.52, 95% CI 13.93-23.11, P<0.00001), and interleukin-2 levels (MD 20.73, 95% CI 16.05-25.41, P<0.0001). In addition, lower CD8 subset (MD -7.85, 95% CI -9.07, -6.63, P<0.00001) and interleukin-10 levels (MD -18.56, 95% CI -22.61, -14.50, P<0.00001) were observed for HS. Conclusion: We identified that simultaneous HS do not increase postoperative complications, operation time, or perioperative mortality in patients with HCC and hypersplenism. Simultaneous splenectomy can increase postoperative white blood cell and platelet counts significantly, improve blood coagulation, reduce the incidence of postoperative bleeding, and enhance immunity. Therefore, HS is safe, effective, and feasible for patients with HCC and hypersplenism.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The role of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) has been rarely studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib in post-LT era. Methods: Consecutive patients with post-transplant HCC recurrence not eligible to resection or locoregional therapy were included. Patients receiving best supportive care (BSC) until 2007 were compared with those treated by sorafenib thereafter. Results: Of a total of 65 patients, 20 patients received BSC and 45 received sorafenib. Clinical characteristics were similar between two groups except that sorafenib group received tacrolimus and mammalian target-of-rapamycin inhibitors more frequently than BSC group. Treatment with sorafenib conferred a survival advantage as compared with BSC for survival after recurrence (median, 14.2 vs. 6.8 months; P = 0.01). In multivariate analyses, high serum α-fetoprotein level, synchronous intrahepatic recurrence and distant metastasis at the time of recurrence, and BSC were independently associated with poorer survival after recurrence. Sorafenib treatment was associated with better survival after recurrence as compared with BSC (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.62; P = 0.002). In addition, sorafenib group showed tolerable toxicity in the post-transplant setting. Conclusion: Sorafenib may be beneficial in patients with post-transplant HCC recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "TIP30 is a tumor suppressor whose expression is altered in human liver, prostate, lung, colon, and breast cancers. Mice lacking TIP30 spontaneously developed hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and other tumors at a higher incidence than wild-type mice. Somatic missense mutations in the TIP30 gene were identified in human HCC tissue specimens, which resulted in instability or abnormal cellular distribution of TIP30 protein in cells. Here, we show that TIP30 mutants are able to promote cell growth and invasion and inhibit cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the HCC cell line HepG2 negative for endogenous TIP30. Moreover, one of the TIP30 mutants can dramatically accelerate tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. Analysis of gene expression in HepG2 cells, ectopically expressing either wild-type TIP30 or mutant TIP30, by Affymetrix GeneChip array, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blotting assays reveals that TIP30 mutants can alter expression of genes involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis. This includes up-regulation of expression of N-cadherin and c-MYC and down-regulation of expression of p53 and E-cadherin. N-cadherin knockdown with small interfering RNA in HepG2 cells expressing mutant TIP30 resulted in a profound reduction in cell viability. Taken together, our data indicate that somatic mutations in the TIP30 gene may abolish its native tumor-suppressor activity and gain oncogenic activities partially through up-regulation of N-cadherin, thereby potentiating the pathogenesis of HCC in patients.",

    "Abstract": "Objective Tolvaptan was first approved for use for cirrhosis in Japan in September 2013. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, on the prognosis of cirrhosis. Methods The effect of tolvaptan was evaluated in 26 patients with cirrhosis treated at our hospital from September 2013 to April 2015. Results The primary disease was hepatitis C in 20 patients, hepatitis B in 2, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in 2 and others in 2; and 12 had hepatocellular carcinoma. The Child-Pugh score was 9.7±1.6 and the serum albumin level was 2.53±0.44 g/dL. Body weight decreased from 55.5±11.8 kg before administration to 52.1±14.7 kg after 7 days of tolvaptan treatment. After 7 days, patients with weight loss ≥2 kg (n=16, mean decrease of 4.3±2.3 kg) had significantly lower blood urea nitrogen (24.2±14.4 vs. 36.1±11.4 mg/dL) and serum creatinine (1.1±0.5 vs. 1.5±0.7 mg/dL) levels and decreased urine osmolality 4 h after the administration of tolvaptan (236±96 vs. 364±122 mOsm/kg) compared with patients with weight loss <2 kg (n=10, mean increase of +0.7±2.1 kg) (all p<0.05). The prognosis was significantly better in the group with weight loss ≥2 kg. Conclusion The effect of tolvaptan on the renal function is likely to improve the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis if the drug is started at a stage in which the renal function is maintained.",

    "Abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major problem in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Certain p53 mutants may enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. To determine whether two frequently occurring p53 mutants, R248Q and R273C, would increase the drug resistance of liver cancer cells, stable cell lines expressing these specific p53 mutants were established by transfecting the p53-null Hep3B cells with mutant p53 expression vectors, and then treating them with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin and paclitaxel. The cells expressing the p53 mutant, R248Q, but not R273C, displayed cross-resistance to both drugs, in contrast to the control cells expressing the vector alone. Moreover, both the expression and the activity of the multiple drug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein, were elevated in p53 mutant R248Q-expressing cells. Reduced uptake of doxorubicin was also observed in the R248Q-expressing cells. These results suggest that expression of the p53 mutant, R248Q, in liver cancer cells may enhance their drug resistance and that upregulation of P-glycoprotein activity may contribute to this protective effect.",

    "Abstract": "Exogenous overexpression of the metastasis suppressor gene Nm23-H1 reduces the metastatic potential of multiple types of cancer cells and suppresses in vitro tumor cell motility and invasion. Mutational analysis of Nm23-H1 revealed that substitution mutants P96S and S120G did not inhibit motility and invasion. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of Nm23-H1 motility suppression, expression microarray analysis of an MDA-MB-435 cancer cell line overexpressing wild-type Nm23-H1 was done and cross-compared with expression profiles from lines expressing the P96S and S120G mutants. Nine genes, MET, PTN, SMO, FZD1, L1CAM, MMP2, NETO2, CTGF, and EDG2, were down-regulated by wild-type but not by mutant Nm23-H1 expression. Reduced expression of these genes coincident with elevated Nm23-H1 expression was observed in human breast tumor cohorts, a panel of breast carcinoma cell lines, and hepatocellular carcinomas from control versus Nm23-M1 knockout mice. The functional significance of the down-regulated genes was assessed by transfection and in vitro motility assays. Only EDG2 overexpression significantly restored motility to Nm23-H1-suppressed cancer cells, enhancing motility by 60-fold in these cells. In addition, silencing EDG2 expression with small interfering RNA reduced the motile phenotype of metastatic breast cancer cells. These data suggest that Nm23-H1 suppresses metastasis, at least in part, through down-regulation of EDG2 expression.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the three-phase helical CT features of early hepatocellular carcinomas, based on the new Japanese classification. Materials and methods: Over the course of an eight-year period, we collected 16 pathologically proven early hepatocellular carcinomas from 16 patients having undergone a three-phase helical CT prior to surgery. The three-phase CT images were acquired at 20-35 sec (arterial phase), 70 sec (portal phase), and 180 sec (equilibrium phase) from the beginning of intravenous injection of contrast material. All the CT images were retrospectively analyzed by two radiologists in consensus, based on their description of morphologic (size, margin, fibrous capsule and mosaic pattern) and enhancement patterns of tumors. Results: Only seven (44%) of the 16 early hepatocellular carcinomas having undergone a CT were described (mean diameter, 1.2 cm; range, 0.4-2.5 cm). All the tumors had an ill-defined margin with no fibrous capsule. The mosaic pattern was found in only one tumor. Only three (43%) of the seven tumors detected on CT were hyperattenuating during the arterial phase. The four remaining tumors (25%) were hypoattenuating throughout the three phases. Conclusion: Despite the higher resolution provided by the three phase scans, the contrast-enhanced CT provides only limited detection of the variable morphologic and enhancement features of early hepatocellular carcinomas.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) rarely occur in males, and if so, are frequently associated with malignant transformation. Guidelines are based on small numbers of patients and advise resection of HCA in male patients, irrespective of size or subtype. This nationwide retrospective cohort study is the largest series of HCA in men correlating (immuno)histopathological and molecular findings with the clinical course. Methods: Dutch male patients with available histological slides with a (differential) diagnosis of HCA between 2000 and 2017 were identified through the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA). Histopathology and immunohistochemistry according to international guidelines were revised by two expert hepatopathologists. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to confirm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and/or subtype HCA. Final pathological diagnosis was correlated with recurrence, metastasis and death. Results: A total of 66 patients from 26 centres fulfilling the inclusion criteria with a mean (±SD) age of 45.0 ± 21.6 years were included. The diagnosis was changed after expert revision and NGS in 33 of the 66 patients (50%). After a median follow-up of 9.6 years, tumour-related mortality of patients with accessible clinical data was 1/18 (5.6%) in HCA, 5/14 (35.7%) in uncertain HCA/HCC and 4/9 (44.4%) in the HCC groups (P = .031). Four B-catenin mutated HCA were identified using NGS, which were not yet identified by immunohistochemistry and expert revision. Conclusions: Expert revision with relevant immunohistochemistry may help the challenging but prognostically relevant distinction between HCA and well-differentiated HCC in male patients. NGS may be more important to subtype HCA than indicated in present guidelines.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims: Risk stratification after cure from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a clinical challenge. We investigated the predictive value of noninvasive surrogates of portal hypertension (liver stiffness measurement [LSM] by vibration-controlled transient elastography and von Willebrand factor/platelet count ratio [VITRO]) for development of hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with pretreatment advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) who achieved HCV cure. Approach and results: A total of 276 patients with pretreatment ACLD and information on pretreatment and posttreatment follow-up (FU)-LSM and FU-VITRO were followed for a median of 36.6 months after the end of interferon-free therapy. FU-LSM (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]: 0.875 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.796-0.954]) and FU-VITRO (AUROC: 0.925 [95% CI: 0.874-0.977]) showed an excellent predictive performance for hepatic decompensation. Both parameters provided incremental information and were significantly associated with hepatic decompensation in adjusted models. A previously proposed combined approach (FU-LSM < 12.4 kPa and/or FU-VITRO < 0.95) to rule out clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH, hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥10 mm Hg) at FU assigned most (57.3%) of the patients to the low-risk group; none of these patients developed hepatic decompensation. In contrast, in patients in whom FU-CSPH was ruled in (FU-LSM > 25.3 kPa and/or FU-VITRO > 3.3; 25.0% of patients), the risk of hepatic decompensation at 3 years following treatment was high (17.4%). Patients within the diagnostic gray-zone for FU-CSPH (17.8% of patients) had a very low risk of hepatic decompensation during FU (2.6%). The prognostic value of this algorithm was validated in an internal (n = 86) and external (n = 162) cohort. Conclusion: FU-LSM/FU-VITRO are strongly and independently predictive of posttreatment hepatic decompensation in HCV-induced ACLD. An algorithm combining these noninvasive markers not only rules in or rules out FU-CSPH, but also identifies populations at negligible versus high risk for hepatic decompensation. FU-LSM/FU-VITRO are readily accessible and enable risk stratification after sustained virological response, and thus facilitate personalized management.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Liver-specific protein genes have multiple cis-/trans-acting elements, but those accountable for hepatocytic differentiation are unclear. An AT-rich core sequence (AT motif) is essential as a cis-acting element for the hepatic transcription. Homologous proteins hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) and variant HNF-1 (vHNF-1) bind to this motif. The ratio of HNF-1 to vHNF-1 mRNA was examined in various liver tissues with respect to their differentiation. Methods: The competitive reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction was employed to amplify HNF-1 and vHNF-1 mRNA simultaneously and to examine their expression ratio in total RNA extracted from frozen liver tissues of 37 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, five patients with hepatoblastoma, and 15 non-neoplastic liver tissues. Results: The ratio of HNF-1 to vHNF-1 mRNA was higher in well-differentiated cases than in poorly-differentiated and undifferentiated cases, except that one poorly-differentiated hepatoblastoma displayed a high ratio. Non-neoplastic liver tissues had low ratios similar to poorly-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, the reason for which remained unknown. However, chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis cases also demonstrated low ratios, and hence degenerative changes themselves displayed no obvious influence on such ratios. Thus, the gene expression of HNF-1 and vHNF-1 seemed to be differentially regulated in neoplastic and non-neoplastic hepatocytes. Conclusions: These results suggested that the ratio of HNF-1 to vHNF-1 mRNA correlated with histological differentiation of HCC and hepatoblastoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: The TCF1 gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1), a transcription factor germline mutated in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3, was recently found to be frequently inactivated by biallelic alterations in liver adenoma and in rare hepatocellular carcinomas. The impact of HNF1 in colorectal carcinogenesis has not been studied until now. Colorectal cancer is characterized by the existence of different molecular mechanisms known as microsatellite stable or unstable tumors. Methods: At first, a series of 10 adenomas and 29 colon cancers regardless of microsatellite instability status were screened for TCF1 mutations on the entire coding sequence. Results: Three mutations in microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) tumors were found in the exon 4 polymorphic poly-cytosin (C)(8) or (C)(9) tract and consisted of a cytosin deletion at position 291. To further characterize the prevalence of TCF1 mutations in the subgroup of MSI-H tumors, 52 additional MSI-H samples were screened for exon 4 alterations; 23% of MSI-H tumors (95% confidence interval, 14%-36%) were found to harbor frameshift at the poly-cytosin tract. The (C)(9) allele was significantly more frequently mutated than the (C)(8) allele (22% vs. 8%; P = 0.03), showing a higher instability of the longer repetition. Conclusions: These results show a role for HNF1 in MSI-H colorectal carcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1α) is a transcription factor expressed predominantly in the liver among other organs. Structurally, it contains POU-homeodomain that binds to DNA and form proteins that help in maintaining cellular homeostasis, controlling metabolism, and differentiating cell lineages. Scientific research over the period of three decades has reported it as an important player in various liver malignancies such as hepatocellular cancers (HCCs), hepatocellular adenoma (HA), and a more specific HNF-1α-inactivated human hepatocellular adenoma (H-HCAs). Abundant clinical and rodent data have noted the downregulation of HNF-1α in parallel with liver malignancies. It is also interesting to notice that the co-occurrence of mutated HNF-1α expression and hepatic carcinomas transpires typically along with metabolic repercussion. Moreover, scientific data implies that HNF-1α exerts its effects on cell stemness and hence can indirectly impact liver malignancies and metabolic functioning. The effects of HNF-1α on cell stemness present a future opportunity to explore a possible and potential breakthrough. Although the mechanism through which inactivated HNF-1α leads to hepatic malignancies remain largely obscure, several key signal molecules or pathways, including TNF-α, SHP-1, CDH17, SIRT, and MIA-2, have been reported to take part in the regulations of HNF-1α. It can be concluded from the present scientific data that HNF-1α has a great potential to serve as a target for liver malignancies and cell stemness.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenomas are rare benign liver neoplasms that commonly occur in women with a history of oral contraceptives intake for more than 2 years. Hepatic adenomatosis is characterized by the presence of multiple adenomas, arbitrarily > than 10, involving both lobes of the liver, without any history of steroid therapy or glycogen storage disease. Although the adenomas in liver adenomatosis are histologically similar to other adenomas, liver adenomatosis appears to be a separate clinical entity. Adenomas in hepatic adenomatosis may be of the inflammatory, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha-mutated, or beta-catenin-mutated subtype, and accordingly show variable imaging appearances. Hepatic adenomatosis carries the risk of impaired liver function, hemorrhage and malignant degeneration. We report a case with the inflammatory subtype of hepatic adenomatosis in a 39-year-old woman with liver steatosis. The magnetic resonance imaging features using extracellular gadolinium chelates and hepatocyte-targeted contrast agents are described.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: α-fetoprotein (AFP) expression is activated during the embryonic stage or hepatocellular carcinogenesis, so it is presumed that AFP is a key endogenous molecule to promote cell proliferation or differentiation. We carried out gene screening in an unknown family with hyper-alpha-fetoproteinemia and some sporadic menopausal women, and discussed the relationship between AFP expression and liver cirrhosis. Methods: Peripheral blood samples from family members, patients with malignant liver tumors, and normal controls were collected. Full-length sequence of AFP was amplified and directly sequenced, and compared with normal controls. HNF-1α and HNF-1β in plasma levels of family members, patients with liver cancer, newborns, pregnant women, and normal subjects were detected by ELISA, and the relationship between HNF-1 and AFP mutation or high expression was evaluated. Results: There was a mutation in AFP promoter region at c.-200 C>T, which was located at the binding site of AFP hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1). AFP was higher than 4000 ng/L in all members carrying the mutation, but liver cancer was excluded in the family with hyper-alpha-fetoprotein. However, cirrhosis occurred in post-menopausal women. The cases reviewed showed that unknown hyper-alpha-fetoprotein was closely related to HNF-1 binding point of AFP in post-menopausal women with cirrhosis (7/11), while the plasma levels of HNF-1α and HNF-1β were not significantly different. Conclusion: The mutation of the HNF-1 binding point of AFP may lead to an abnormal high expression of AFP by altering the binding of HNF transcription factors, which is closely related to cirrhosis in menopausal women.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Telangiectatic focal nodular hyperplasia (TFNH) of the liver is generally believed to belong to the focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) family. The aim of this study was to use molecular markers, in addition to morphologic features, to better characterize TFNH. Methods: Thirteen patients with TFNH were compared with 28 patients with FNH and 17 patients with hepatocellular adenoma. Full clinical and morphologic data were analyzed. Molecular markers included determination of clonality by examining the active X chromosome, genome-wide allelotyping, a search for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) mutations, and determination of ANGPT1/ANGPT2 transcript levels. Results: No clinical differences were evident between patients with TFNH and adenoma; in particular, bleeding was observed in 77% and 53% of the cases, respectively. Patients with TFNH were more likely to experience nodule recurrence and the presence of multiple nodules than those with either FNH or adenoma. All TFNH and adenoma samples that were available for analysis were monoclonal, in contrast to 40% of the FNH samples. Chromosome losses confirmed monoclonality and were significantly less frequent in TFNH and FNH (22% and 26%) than in adenoma (53%). HNF1alpha mutations were found exclusively in half of the adenomas. ANGPT2 was overexpressed in TFNH and down-regulated in adenoma (P < .01) and FNH (P < .0005). Conclusions: TFNHs are monoclonal lesions frequently subject to bleeding that are similar to adenomas not carrying HNF1alpha mutations and require a similar type of treatment. However, morphologic and molecular data support the hypothesis that TFNH is a separate entity.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Hepatic adenomas (HAs) are a benign and relatively rare type of liver neoplasms. We review the diagnosis, evaluation, and potential therapeutic management options for patients with HA. Methods: A comprehensive review of the English literature was performed utilizing MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases with end of search date the 30th April of 2018. In PubMed, the terms \"hepatocellular,\" \"hepatic,\" \"liver,\" and \"adenoma,\" \"adenomatosis\" were searched in the title and/or abstract. Results: Recent advances in molecular classification of HA have determined distinct subtypes with specific clinical, pathological, and imaging characteristics. In general, cessation of exogenous hormonal administration or weight loss may lead to HA regression. Surgical resection, either open or laparoscopic, should be considered in patients with symptoms and risk factors for hemorrhage or malignant transformation. These risk factors include tumor diameter greater than 5 cm, β-catenin activated subtype, and/or male gender. The management of acute hemorrhage should primarily aim at achieving hemodynamic stability via angioembolization followed by elective resection, whereas malignant transformation is treated according to oncologic resection principles. Although pregnancy is one of the known risk factors for tumor growth and associated complications, the presence of an HA per se should not be considered a contradiction to pregnancy. Conclusion: Future genomic-based multicenter studies are required to provide a strong basis for formulating an evidence-based risk-adapted model that guides individualized management strategies for patients with HA.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular adenoma is a heterogeneous group of benign neoplasms arising from hepatocellular cells and can be subclassified into four major groups based on genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. These four subtypes are hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1α-inactivated, β-catenin-activated, inflammatory, and unclassified adenomas. Immunohistochemistry studies have demonstrated that since β-catenin-activated adenomas have a higher risk of malignant transformation, the identification of the subtype of adenoma remains crucial in patient management. However, malignant transformation of hepatic adenoma without β-catenin overexpression can be seen in 30-65% cases. We report a case of malignant transformation of hepatic adenoma without overexpression of β-catenin in a 31-year-old man with a known glycogen storage disease (GSD) Type-1a, which was diagnosed on surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI showed a mild interval increase in one lesion with relative stability of the other adenomas. The lesion was presumed to be suspicious for a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and was confirmed on pathology.",

    "Abstract": "During the last three decades liver cell adenoma and liver cell adenomatosis have emerged as new clinical entities in hepato-logical practice due to the widespread use of oral contraceptives and increased imaging of the liver. On review of published series there is evidence that 10% of liver cell adenomas progress to hepatocellular carcinoma, diagnosis is best made by open or laparoscopic excision biopsy, and the preferred treatment modality is resection of the liver cell adenoma to prevent bleeding and malignant transformation. In liver cell adenomatosis, the association with oral contraceptive use is not as high as in solitary liver cell adenomas. The risk of malignant transformation is not increased compared with solitary liver cell adenomas. Treatment consists of close monitoring and imaging, resection of superficially located, large (>4 cm) or growing liver cell adenomas. Liver transplantation is the last resort in case of substantive concern about malignant transformation or for large, painful adenomas in liver cell adenomatosis after treatment attempts by liver resection.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatic adenomatosis and hepatocellular adenomas share risk factors and the same pathophysiologic spectrum. The presence in the liver of 10 hepatocellular adenomas defines hepatic adenomatosis. The diagnosis may be established incidentally during a liver radiologic examination in the asymptomatic patient, or after associated right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly or liver test abnormalities. Upon the diagnosis of hepatic adenomatosis or either of its life-threatening complications - hemorrhage and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma - consideration should be given to potential medical, radiologic and surgical interventions including: observation (estrogens and androgens withdrawal), resection, transarterial embolization, radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation. The management of patients with hepatic adenomatosis can be challenging. These patients should be ideally referred to centers with expertise in the management of liver diseases.",

The clinical data of 329 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) admitted to Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital from June 2015 to December 2017 were collected. One hundred and sixty patients with PHCC were regarded as the PHCC group, and the other 169 patients with RHCC were regarded as the RHCC group. US and MRI were used in the imaging diagnosis of both groups and the results of US combined with MRI, US, and MRI alone were compared. The lesion size in the PHCC group was significantly higher than that in the RHCC group (P<0.05). The MRI fast-in and fast-out rates of the two groups were significantly higher than those of the other three methods (P<0.05). The coincidence rate of MRI in the two groups was higher than that of computed tomography (CT), US, and US combined with MRI (P<0.05). The coincidence rates of CT, US, MRI, and US combined with MRI in PHCC group were significantly higher than those in RHCC group. In PHCC group, MRI was superior to the other methods in the detection of micro HCC (P<0.05). In RHCC group, MRI was significantly better than US in the detection of micro HCC (P<0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of MRI were significantly better than the other three methods (P<0.05). MRI alone has the best diagnostic efficacy for micro HCC-type lesions. The diagnostic efficacy of MRI, US, CT, and US combined with MRI in PHCC was better than those in RHCC. In addition to imaging examination, the diagnosis of RHCC should be combined with other indicators for comprehensive diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with inferior vena cava and right atrium thrombus is rare, accounting for approximately 1.4%-4.9% of cases. These patients are rarely reported, but the condition is being increasingly discovered with advances in imaging techniques, and their prognosis is extremely pessimistic with no current effective treatment. This condition is further associated with unexpected sudden death by cardiac arrest and acute large area pulmonary embolism. Case summary: A 34-year-old man with advanced HCC with a hepatic vein thrombus extending into the right atrium had a long-term, disease-free survival following 5-mo sequential treatment combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and curative liver resection. No severe adverse effects were encountered, such as massive hemorrhage or pulmonary embolism. The proper selection of operative method is an important factor. Conclusion: HCC with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium has a significant impact on the survival of patients. Thrombectomy combined with adjuvant therapy may be beneficial for these patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Advanced inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) conferring a grave prognosis may benefit from yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization. Methods: Thirty patients with advanced inoperable HCC including those with any lesion >8 cm in maximal diameter or multiple bi-lobar lesions (totally more than five lesions), or portal vein thrombosis treated with radioembolization were reviewed. Treatment efficacy and safety were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for identifying potential prognostic factors. Results: After a median follow-up of 18.3 months, the response rate was 30.0%, and the disease control rate was 50.0%. Median overall progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.3 months and 13.2 months, respectively. Longer median PFS was noted in those who had transarterial chemoembolization before radioembolization (7.3 months vs 3.1 months; P=0.021) and duration of alfafeto protein (AFP) response ≥6 months (11.8 months vs 3.0 months; P<0.001). Longer median OS was also revealed in those without portal vein thrombosis (17.1 months vs 4.4 months; P=0.015) and those whose duration of AFP response was ≥6 months (21.2 months vs 8.6 months; P=0.001). Seventeen patients (56.7%) developed treatment-related complications including five (16.7%) grade 3 events. Multivariate analysis revealed that treatment responders (P=0.001) and duration of AFP response ≥6 months (P=0.006) were prognostic of PFS, whereas the absence of portal vein invasion (P=0.025), treatment responders (P=0.010), and duration of AFP response ≥6 months (P=0.001) were prognostic of OS. Conclusion: (90)Y radioembolization is an alternative treatment with a promising outcome for poor-risk advanced inoperable HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is involved in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs10204525, located in the PD1 3' untranslated regions (UTR), is associated with chronic HBV infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression via specific binding to the target 3'UTR of mRNA. In this study, three miRNAs were predicted to putatively interact with PD1 rs10204525 polymorphic site of allele G. One of them, miRNA-4717, was demonstrated to allele-specifically affect luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner in cells transfected with vectors containing different rs10204525 alleles. In lymphocytes from chronic HBV patients withrs10204525 genotype GG, miR-4717 mimics significantly decreased PD-1 expression and increased (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ production. miR-4717 inhibitor significantly increased PD-1 expression and decreased TNF-α and IFN-γ production although not significantly. In lymphocytes from chronic HBV patients with rs10204525 genotype AA, no similar effects were observed. miR-4717 levels in peripheral lymphocytes from patients with HBV-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC were significantly decreased. In conclusion, miR-4717 may allele-specifically regulate PD-1 expression through interaction with the 3' UTR of PD1 mRNA, leading to the alteration of immune regulation and affecting the susceptibility and disease course of chronic HBV infection.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To characterize thyroid disturbances induced by interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Introduction: Interferon-alpha is used to treat chronic hepatitis C infections. This compound commonly induces both autoimmune and non-autoimmune thyroiditis. Methods: We prospectively selected 26 patients with chronic hepatitis C infections. Clinical examinations, hormonal evaluations, and color-flow Doppler ultrasonography of the thyroid were performed before and during antiviral therapy. Results: Of the patients in our study, 54% had no thyroid disorders associated with the interferon-alpha therapy but showed reduced levels of total T3 along with a decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase. Total T4 levels were also reduced at 3 and 12 months, but free T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels remained stable. A total of 19% of the subjects had autoimmune interferon-induced thyroiditis, which is characterized by an emerge of antithyroid antibodies or overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, 16% had non-autoimmune thyroiditis, which presents as destructive thyroiditis or subclinical hypothyroidism, and 11% remained in a state of euthyroidism despite the prior existence of antithyroidal antibodies. Thyrotoxicosis with destructive thyroiditis was diagnosed within three months of therapy, and ultrasonography of these patients revealed thyroid shrinkage and discordant change in the vascular patterns. Discussion: Decreases in the total T3 and total T4 levels may be related to improvements in the hepatocellular lesions or inflammatory changes similar to those associated with nonthyroidal illnesses. The immune mechanisms and direct effects of interferon-alpha can be associated with thyroiditis. Conclusion: Interferon-alpha and ribavirin induce autoimmune and non-autoimmune thyroiditis and hormonal changes (such as decreased total T3 and total T4 levels), which occur despite stable free T4 and TSH levels. A thyroid hormonal evaluation, including the analysis of the free T4, TSH, and antithyroid antibody levels, should be mandatory before therapy, and an early re-evaluation within three months of treatment is necessary as an appropriate follow-up.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Mosaic G-protein alpha-subunit (GNAS)-activating mutations are responsible for the McCune-Albright (MCA) syndrome. This oncogene that activates the adenylate cyclase is also mutated in various tumor types leading to the accumulation of cyclic-AMP. Identification of a hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) in two MCA patients led us to search for GNAS activation in benign and malignant hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Methods: GNAS mutations were screened by sequencing 164 HCA, 245 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 17 fibrolamellar carcinomas. Tumors were characterized by quantitative RT-PCR, gene mutation screening and pathological reviewing. The consequences of wild type and mutant GNAS expression were analyzed in hepatocellular cell lines. Results: A somatic GNAS-activating mutation was identified in 5 benign tumors and in 2 HCC. In benign tumors, GNAS mutations were exclusive from HNF1A, CTNNB1, and IL6ST mutations whereas one HCC demonstrated both CTNNB1 and GNAS mutations. Quantitative RT-PCR showed an activation of the IL-6 and interferon pathways in GNAS-mutated tumor tissues. Accordingly, pathological reviewing identified in GNAS-mutated tumors an inflammatory phenotype characterized by fibrosis and STAT3 activation. We further demonstrated in HCC cell lines that GNAS mutant expression induced inflammatory response and STAT3 activation. Conclusions: We identified for the first time the association between two rare diseases, MCA syndrome and HCA occurrence, but also that somatic GNAS-activating mutations in sporadic benign and malignant liver tumors are characterized by an inflammatory phenotype. These results showed a cross-talk between cyclic-AMP and JAK/STAT pathways in liver tumors and they reinforce the role of STAT3 activation in liver tumorigenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although lenvatinib was recently approved for treatment of advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on the phase III REFLECT trial, no biomarkers for management of lenvatinib treatment have been established. The aim of this study is to identify predictive biomarkers for the management of lenvatinib treatment in advanced HCC patients. Methods: A total of 41 patients with advanced HCC were enrolled in this retrospective study. Serum levels of 22 circulating cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAFs) were measured by multiplex Luminex assay. Profiles of CAFs, clinical chemistry/hematology parameters, and clinical background were evaluated to explore biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes. Results: Relative dose intensity (RDI) decreased significantly between weeks 1-2 and 3-4 (p < 0.001), and RDI during weeks 3-4 was a prominent indicator of progression-free survival (PFS). A signature based on baseline serum levels of nine CAFs associated with low RDI was identified. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, patients with a favorable 9-CAFs signature [hazard ratio (HR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-0.96, p = 0.040] had lower risk, and Child-Pugh grade B (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-8.3, p = 0.026) and presence of macrovascular invasion (MVI; HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.0-8.3, p = 0.045) had higher risk of shorter PFS. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that RDI is an important predictive factor for longer PFS during lenvatinib treatment. In this hypothesis-generating exploratory analysis, we report that a CAF-signature associated with adverse events and RDI could predict PFS, which might contribute to improved management of lenvatinib treatment in HCC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly being recognized after hepatectomy. This study aimed to identify factors predicting its occurrence and its impact on long-term outcome among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of the incidence of AKI, factors predicting its occurrence, and its impact on patients undergoing hepatectomy between September 2007 and December 2018. A subgroup analysis included patients with histologically proven HCC. Results: The incidence of AKI was 9.2 per cent in 930 patients. AKI was associated with increased mortality, morbidity, posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), and a longer hospital stay. On multivariable analysis, study period December 2013 to December 2018, diabetes mellitus, mean intraoperative BP below 72.1 mmHg, operative blood loss exceeding 377ml, high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and PHLF were predictive factors for AKI. Among 560 patients with HCC, hypertension, BP below 76.9 mmHg, blood loss greater than 378ml, MELD score, and PHLF were predictive factors. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 74.1, 59.2, and 51.6 per cent respectively for patients with AKI, and 91.8, 77.9, and 67.3 per cent for those without AKI. Corresponding 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 56.9, 42.3, and 35.4 per cent respectively in the AKI group, and 71.7, 54.5, and 46.2 per cent in the no-AKI group. AKI was an independent predictor of survival in multivariable analysis. Conclusion: AKI is associated with longer hospital stay, and higher morbidity and mortality rates. It is also associated with shorter long-term survival among patients with HCC. To avoid AKI, control of blood loss and maintaining a reasonable BP (72-77 mmHg) during hepatectomy is important.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the serology of hepatitis A, B, and C in patients with cirrhosis and intensive alcohol consumption. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the viral serology results of 817 patients with cirrhosis and intensive alcohol consumption who presented to the Gastroenterology Clinic of Atatürk Training and Research Hospital of Izmir Katip Çelebi University between April 2008 and December 2017. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on clinical and biochemical evaluations and imaging results. Patients consuming absolute alcohol 40 g/day for >10 years were included and those who quit drinking ≥15 years ago were excluded. Results: Of all the patients, 806 (98.7%) were positive for anti-HAV IgG, 159 (19.5%) for HBsAg, and 32 (3.9%) for anti-HCV. Genotyping was performed in 13 patients. Genotype 1 was detected in 10 patients (1a, one patient; 1b, nine patients) and genotype 3 in three patients. Of the patients with HBV, 10.0% had HBeAg and 7.6% had anti-delta. One-hundred and two (12.5%) patients had HCC, and of these, six (5.9%) were HCV-positive and 53 (52.0%) were HBsAg-positive. Conclusion: Patients with cirrhosis and intensive alcohol consumption have an increased hepatitis B and C prevalence. Patients with chronic viral hepatitis with alcohol habit are at a higher risk for HCC. Therefore, patients with cirrhosis and intensive alcohol consumption should be screened for hepatitis B and C.",

    "Abstract": "E-cadherin mediates cell-cell adhesion by associating with catenins. Loss of E-cadherin function by genetic or epigenetic alteration of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) leads to tumorigenesis. To study the involvement of E-cadherin dysfunction in liver tumorigenesis, we examined the allelic loss and methylation of 5'-CpG sites of CDH1 in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of CDH1 and adjacent 16q22-23 loci was observed in 13 of 30 (43%) HCCs. Methylation of the 5'-CpG of CDH1 was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization, and hypermethylation was observed in 8 of the 24 (33%) HCCs examined. The amount of E-cadherin mRNA was analyzed by RNase protection assay, and a decrease in E-cadherin mRNA was observed in 10 of the 23 cases examined. A reduction in E-cadherin was found in 10 of 21 HCCs using immunoblot analysis. The amount of E-cadherin was comparable to that of E-cadherin mRNA. Down-regulation of E-cadherin was common in cases with LOH but rare in cases with methylated promoter. These results suggest that hypermethylation of the CDH1 promoter is present in a small cell population in the tumor, thus the methylation status is liable to vary according to individual cell condition. Hypermethylation was observed in early stage HCCs, whereas LOH was found frequently in more malignant tumors. Down-regulation of E-cadherin is closely related to the progression of HCCs and is stably induced by LOH of CDH1.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have multiple lesions (primary tumors, intrahepatic metastases, multiple occurrences, satellite nodules, and tumor thrombi); these have been associated with a poor prognosis and tumor recurrence after surgery. We investigated the clonal relationship among these lesions on the basis of genetic features. Methods: We collected 43 lesions and 10 matched control samples (blood or nontumorous liver) from 10 patients with hepatitis B virus-associated HCC treated at Tianjin Cancer Hospital (China) from January 2013 through May 2014. We performed exome and low-depth, whole-genome sequencing on these samples. Genomic aberrations, including somatic mutations and copy number variations, were identified using germline DNA as control. We compared the genetic features of different lesions from each patient and constructed phylogenetic trees to depict their evolutionary histories. Results: In each patient, mutations shared by all the lesions were called ubiquitous mutations. The percentage of ubiquitous mutations varied from 8% to 97% among patients, indicating variation in the extent of intratumor heterogeneity. Branched evolution was evident, with somatic mutations, hepatitis B virus integrations, and copy number variations identified on both the trunks and branches of the phylogenetic trees. Intrahepatic metastases and tumor thrombi contained some, but not all, of the mutations detected in their matched primary lesions. By contrast, satellite nodules shared approximately 90% of mutations detected in primary lesions. In a patient with multicentric tumors, 6 lesions were assigned to 2 distinct groups, based on significant differences in genetic features. In another patient with combined hepatocellular and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the physically separate HCC and cholangiocarcinoma lesions shared 102 mutations. Conclusions: The extent of intratumor heterogeneity varies considerably among patients with HCC. Therefore, sequence analysis of a single lesion cannot completely characterize the genomic features of HCC in some patients. Genomic comparisons of multiple lesions associated with HCCs will provide important information on the genetic changes associated with tumor progression.",

    "Abstract": "A meta-analysis was performed to ascertain to what extent hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative/anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc)-positive subjects with chronic liver disease are at a higher risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than the anti-HBc-negative.All studies included had to fulfill the following characteristics and inclusion criteria: they investigated the relationship between HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive serology and the occurrence of HCC, whether a case-control or cohort study, they provided relative risk (RR) or odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were available as a full text written in English, and were published and indexed up to April 2015.Twenty-six original studies met the inclusion criteria, allowing a meta-analysis on 44,553 patients. The risk of HCC among the 9986 anti-HBc-positive subjects was 67% higher than in the 34,567 anti-HBc-negative (95% CI = 1.44-1.95, P < 0.0001). The results were similar when groups of patients with a different stage of liver disease (patients with chronic liver disease, patients with cirrhosis), with different ethnicity (Asian and non-Asian) and etiology (HCV and non-HCV) were considered. The risk of HCC was significantly higher in the 651 anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive patients (RR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.17-1.58, P = 0.03) and in the 595 anti-HBs-negative/anti-HBc-positive subjects (RR = 2.15; 95% CI = 1.58-2.92, P < 0.0001) than in the 1242 anti-HBs/anti-HBc negative. However, the RR from 8 studies indicated that the risk of HCC was 35% lower among the anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive subjects compared to the anti-HBs-negative/anti-HBc-positive (RR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.52-0.8, P < 0.0001).This meta-analysis shows that in HBsAg-negative subjects with chronic liver disease, anti-HBc positivity is strongly associated with the presence of HCC, an association observed in all subgroups according to the stage of the disease, etiology, and ethnicity.",

    "Abstract": "The global burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is profound, and represents a public health threat as chronic infection can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The risk factors for chronic hepatitis B-related liver disease differ according to HBV endemicity, hepatitis B e-antigen seropositivity, and viral load. It is important to identify these risk factors and start antiviral treatment at an appropriate time according to current guidelines. The most crucial step in reducing HBV infection is prevention in infancy or early childhood, as infection at an early stage may lead to chronicity. South Korea was formerly an HBV-endemic area, but the epidemiology of HBV infection was changed by the introduction of vaccination in 1983 and nationwide immunization in 1995. The government and the private sector made efforts to reduce the prevalence of HBV infection, and Korea is on target to meet the World Health Organization goal of eliminating viral hepatitis by 2030. To eliminate hepatitis worldwide, the costs of antiviral treatment to prevent perinatal HBV transmission in pregnant women with high viremia should be covered by a national program, and strategies to reduce the prevalence of HBV infection in immigrant populations are needed.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation combined with transarterial chemoembolization in patients with specially located small hepatocellular carcinoma. Materials and methods: Between March 2014 and March 2017, a total of 26 patients with 26 lesions (10 perivascular, 6 subdiaphragmatic, 5 subcapsular, 5 perivascular, and subdiaphragmatic location; mean diameter 2.12 (0.62) cm), who received radiofrequency ablation-transarterial chemoembolization treatment, were retrospectively analyzed. Local tumor response was assessed by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging 1 month after the procedure. Tumor-free survival was also assessed according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Complications were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). Results: Complete response was achieved in all patients 1 month after the procedure. During a median follow-up duration of 16.76 months (95% confidence interval: 7.78-25.73 months), local tumor recurrence occurred in 2 patients and new intrahepatic lesions developed in 7 patients. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative local tumor progression rates were 3.84%, 7.69%, and 7.69%, respectively. The median tumor-free survival duration was 21.96 months (95% confidence interval: 17.58-26.34 months). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year tumor-free survival rates were 67.4%, 46.1%, and 39.3%, respectively. Conclusion: The radiofrequency ablation-transarterial chemoembolization combination therapy appears to be safe and effective and might be a treatment option for specially located small hepatocellular carcinoma lesions that have a risk of incomplete ablation or major complications.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND The risk of postoperative liver dysfunction (PLD) in patients with injured livers, such as in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is still not negligible. Phenacetin metabolism test can reflect hepatic functional reserve in patients with chronic hepatic damage. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of phenacetin metabolism test to predict PLD in patients with HCC receiving partial hepatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-nine patients with HCC undergoing partial hepatectomy between 2014 and 2016 were included at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University. The phenacetin metabolism test was used to assess the hepatic functional reserve. The ratio of total plasma paracetamol to phenacetin was collected in patients at 2 h after oral administration of 1.0 g phenacetin, recorded 5 days prior to surgery and on the fifth postoperative day. Phenacetin metabolism test, Child-Pugh classification, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score were correlated with PLD. RESULTS Of 49 patients with HCC, 13 patients (26.5%) had PLD. The association between the ratio of total plasma paracetamol to phenacetin and PLD was statistically significant (p=0.0061) and the correlation coefficient was -0.647 (p=0.0082). The phenacetin metabolism test showed a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value (0.735) than Child-Pugh's classification (0.472) and MELD score (0.419). Using the calculated cutoff of 0.6, the lower ratio of total plasma paracetamol to phenacetin preoperatively was chosen to specifically identify patients with PLD. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.657 and 0.892, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Phenacetin metabolism test could be preoperatively used in predicting PLD in HCC patients receiving partial hepatectomy. It potentially provides better prediction than Child-Pugh classification and MELD score.",

    "Abstract": "Parkinsonia aculeata L. growing in Saudi Arabia was investigated for its phytochemical profile, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties. UPLC-ESI-MS/MS was employed as a powerful technique for the characterization of secondary metabolites from a hydroalcoholic extract, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate fractions of P. aculeata L. aerial parts. Sixty-nine compounds (flavonoids, anthocyanins, phenolics and fatty acids) were detected and characterized; flavonoids were the abundant components in the analyzed samples. The dichloromethane fraction was rich in phenolics as vanillic acid hexoside, flavonols as 3,7-dimthylquercetin, and flavones as 3'-hydroxymelanettin. However, the ethyl acetate fraction was rich in flavonoid-C-glycosides as luteolin-8-C-β-D-glucoside (orientin) and apigenin-8-C-glucoside (vitexin), flavonoid- O, C-diglycosides such as luteolin 7-O-[6''-dihydrogalloyl]-glucosyl-8-C-pentosyl-(1 → 2)-glucoside and 2''-O-rhamnosyl isoorientin. These compounds were identified for the first time in dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions of Saudi P. aculeata L. Additionally, all the samples were assessed for antioxidant activity using DPPH radical scavenging method and for cytotoxic activity through MTT assay. Accordingly, the most active fraction was the ethyl acetate which showed the highest antioxidant activity (SC50 = 57.4 ± 1.2 μg/mL) compared with the positive control, ascorbic acid (SC50 = 12.4 ± 0.5 μg/mL) and moderate cytotoxicity against HepG-2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) and MCF-7 (breast carcinoma) cell lines with IC50 = 56.9 ± 3.1 and 95.8 ± 3.8 μg/mL, respectively compared with cisplatin (IC50 = 3.67 ± 0.22 and 5.71 ± 0.57 μg/mL, respectively for both cell lines). The antioxidant and cytotoxic activities may be attributed to the presence of high percentage of phenolic compounds and hydroxylated flavonoids detected in ethyl acetate fraction using UPLS-ESI-MS/MS.",

Aim: To evaluate the histological findings and the effects of the prophylactic total thyroidectomy in first-degree relatives of Chilean patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) based on the Ret proto-oncogene analysis. Subjects and methods: Nineteen patients belonging to 11 MEN 2 families underwent total thyroidectomy. Of these, 16 either with C cell hyperplasia (CCH) or microscopic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) were selected for the final analysis. Results: The age at the moment of thyroidectomy ranged from 3 to 24 years (median 9.5). The most common mutation was located in codon 634 (69%) followed by codon 620 (25%). Histopathology revealed MTC in 13 patients (81%, youngest 3 years, oldest ones 19 and 24 years) and CCH in 3. A significant correlation was observed between basal preoperative serum calcitonin/tumor size (r = 0.53, P < 0.05) and age/tumor size (r = 0.56, P < 0.03), but not between basal preoperative serum calcitonin and age. Stimulated preoperative calcitonin levels were confounding and not useful for differentiating CCH from MTC. None of patients in whom cervical dissection was done (9/16) presented lymph node metastases, including the oldest ones. All patients but the older ones were biochemically cured after a mean of 5 years of follow-up. Conclusion: Prophylactic total thyroidectomy should be done early in life because there is an age-dependent progression from HCC to MTC. MTC often precedes biochemical detection of the disease.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/aims: Intrahepatic recurrence is frequent result after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We analyzed the clinical results of patients who had the intrahepatic recurrences of HCC after curative surgical resections. Methods: From January 2009 to December 2016, 320 patients underwent curative surgical resection for HCC in department of Surgery, Korea Cancer Center Hospital. After surgical resection, 155 patients had suffered HCC recurrence during follow-up period. Among them, 122 patients had only intrahepatic recurrence initially, who were included in this retrospective study. We analyzed about the period of the recurrence after surgery, treatment methods for the recurred tumors, and poor prognostic factors for survival after intrahepatic recurrences. Results: Among the 122 patients, 83 patients had recurrence within 24 months after surgery. Thirty-eight patients underwent curative treatment for the recurred tumors (re-resection in 18, radiofrequency ablation in 20 patients). Non-curative treatments were performed in 77 patients (TACE in 68 patients, radiotherapy in 9 patients) and conservative management in 7 patients. Five-year survival rate of patients who underwent curative treatment is 86.4% (p≤0.001). Five-year survival rate of non-curative treatment is 55.7% (p≤0.001), conservative management is 0% (p=0.021). Among the clinical factors, non-curative treatment for recurred tumor, AFP level at the time of recurrence, size of recurred tumor were independent poor prognostic factors for survival after intrahepatic recurrences (p<0.001). Conclusions: For the patients who had intrahepatic recurrent HCC after surgery, aggressive local treatment can improve the prognosis in selective cases. Further study is necessary to validate this retrospective investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) appears effective for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Evaluation of prognostic factors is imperative for patient selection and improving treatment efficacy. This study aimed to assess sarcopenia as a predictor of the outcome of RFA in patients with HCC. Methods: This prospective study included all patients with HCC on top of HCV-related cirrhosis who underwent RFA and followed up for a minimum of two years. CT scan was used to determine the skeletal muscle index at the psoas, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, transversus abdominis, external and internal obliques, and rectus abdominis muscles. Cross-sectional areas were calculated to obtain a lumbar skeletal muscle index (L3-SMI). Results: A total of 97 patients were enrolled in the study. The L3-SMI was 46.2±12.1 cm2/m2. Older age was the only risk factor associated with sarcopenia (p = 0.001). The overall survival at two years for the whole group was 65.2%. Sarcopenia and MELD score were independent predictors of OS at two years with HR of 7.6 (95% CI: 3.1-18.7) and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.0-4.8), respectively. Recurrence-free survival was 84.1% at two years. Recurrence was not affected by all factors, including sarcopenia. Conclusion: Sarcopenia is a surrogate predictor of overall survival at two years in HCC patients after RFA. Sarcopenia assessment might be an additional prognostic indicator with conventional biomarkers to optimize the selection criteria for receiving RFA for early-stage HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: Pharmacologic agents targeting bile acid signaling show promise for treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, clinical findings suggest that new treatment strategies with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized undesired effects are needed. This preclinical study investigates whether combining an apical sodium-bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor GSK233072 (GSK672) and fibroblast growth factor-15 (FGF15) signaling activation improves anti-NASH efficacy. Methods: Mice with high fat, cholesterol, and fructose (HFCFr) diet-induced NASH and stage 2 fibrosis are used as a NASH model. GSK672 or AAV8-TBG-FGF15 interventions are administered alone or in combination to HFCFr diet-fed mice. Results: The combined treatment significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy against steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis than either single treatment. Mechanistically, the synergistic actions of GSK672 and FGF15 on inhibiting gut bile acid reuptake and hepatic bile acid synthesis achieve greater magnitude of bile acid pool reduction that not only decreases bile acid burden in NASH livers but also limits intestinal lipid absorption, which, together with FGF15 signaling activation, produces weight loss, reduction of adipose inflammation, and attenuated hepatocellular organelle stress. Furthermore, the combined treatment attenuates increased fecal bile acid excretion and repressed bile acid synthesis, which underlie diarrhea and hypercholesterolemia associated with ASBT inhibition and FGF19 analogue, respectively, in clinical settings. Conclusions: Concomitant ASBT inhibition and FGF15 signaling activation produce metabolic changes that partially mimic the bariatric surgery condition whereby lipid malabsorption and increased FGF15/19 signaling synergistically mediate weight loss and metabolic improvement. Further clinical studies may be warranted to investigate whether combining ASBT inhibitor and FGF19 analogue enhances anti-NASH efficacy and reduced treatment-associated adverse events in humans.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Although clinical use of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin has been approved for patients infected with genotype 2 hepatitis C virus, patients ≥ 75-years-old have not been included in previous clinical trials. Aim: To evaluate the real-world safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for elderly patients (≥ 75-years-old) compared to nonelderly patients, we conducted a post-marketing prospective cohort study. Methods: We treated 265 patients with genotype 2 hepatitis C virus using standard approved doses of sofosbuvir (400 mg/d) plus ribavirin adjusted by body weight, administered orally for 12 wk. Results: Sustained virological response rates for the overall cohort, patients < 65-years-old, ≥ 65-years-old but < 75-years-old, and ≥ 75-years-old were 97% (258/265), 98% (93/95), 97% (84/87), and 98% (81/83), respectively (P = 0.842). Logistic regression analyses identified history of hepatocellular carcinoma treatment and alpha-fetoprotein as factors significantly associated with sustained virological response. Alpha-fetoprotein was the only independent factor identified. Sustained virological response rate was significantly lower for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treatment (91%) than for patients without history of hepatocellular carcinoma treatment (98%, P = 0.004). One patient (0.4%) discontinued treatment due to drug-induced pneumonia. Dose reduction or interruption of ribavirin was required for 12.1% (32/265) of patients because of anemia, including 7.7% (14/182) of patients < 75-years-old and 21.7% (18/83) of patients ≥ 75-years-old (P = 0.002). Conclusion: Although ribavirin dose reduction or interruption was required with advanced age, sofosbuvir plus ribavirin appears tolerable and highly effective even in patients ≥ 75-years-old.",

    "Abstract": "Rationale: Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder which etiology is unknown. It is divided into 2 subtypes: the plasma cell variant and the hyaline vascular variant. The most common site is the hilum of the lungs and mediastinum. Castleman disease is often ignored by clinicians because of not frequently encountering in clinical and the lower uptake of F-FDG. Here, we report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by Castleman disease in the hilum of the liver, which was misdiagnosed as the lymph node metastasis in F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Patient concerns: A 63-year-old male with chief complaint of acratia and poor appetite for 2 weeks. Diagnoses: Hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by Castleman disease in the hilum of liver. Interventions: Right hemihepatectomy and hilar lymph node dissection was performed and preventative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization therapy was given after the surgery. Outcomes: The case had multiple systemic metastasis due to tumor progression. Lessons: Castleman disease is a benign and rare lympholiferative disease, and easy to be ignored in clinical. The case of hepatic carcinoma with Castleman disease in the hilum of liver has never been reported before. Here, we report it and hope it provides a differential diagnosis for clinicians in the following similar cases.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: A hepatic schwannoma is extremely rare and difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Presentation of case: We report the case of a 47-year-old male patient who was referred to our hospital for the close investigation of a hepatic tumor which had not been detected two years earlier. An enhanced computed tomography revealed a well-circumscribed and encapsulated tumor with a size of 50mm which was adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the right hepatic vein. The tumor was heterogeneously enhanced until the equilibrium phase. A magnetic resonance image showed a hypointense area on a T1-weighted image and a hyperintense area on a T2-weighted image. These findings differed from those of common malignant hepatic tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal liver metastases. The tumor was most likely a mucus-producing tumor or a liquefactive degenerated adenocarcinoma. Although we could not confirm an exact diagnosis of the tumor, we performed a surgical resection in view of the possibility of malignancy. The patient underwent a limited liver resection with resection of the IVC. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a benign schwannoma comprised of Antoni A and B areas. The nuclear palisading formation of the tumor showed Verocay bodies. Discussion: 15 cases of hepatic schwannoma are reviewed to clarify the typical radiological features. The radiological findings of the present case were consistent with those of the hepatic schwannoma when considering retrospectively. Conclusion: A precise preoperative diagnosis of hepatic schwannoma is difficult, and liver resection is recommended when a hepatic schwannoma is suspected.",

    "Abstract": "Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), an effective agent against acute promyelocytic leukemia, has been reported to inhibit the viability of solid tumors cell lines recently. The detailed molecular mechanism underlying the As(2)O(3)-induced inactivation of the cdc2 and possible functional role of PTEN in the observed G2/M arrest has yet to be elucidated. Here, we assessed the role of PTEN in regulation of As(2)O(3)-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest in Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and SMMC7721). After 24 h following treatment, As(2)O(3) induced a concentration-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The sustained G2/M arrest by As(2)O(3) is associated with decreased cdc2 protein and increased phospho-cdc2(Tyr15). As(2)O(3) treatment increased Wee1 levels and decreased phospho-Wee1(642). Moreover, As(2)O(3) substantially decreased the Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt and upregulated PTEN expression. Downregulation of PTEN by siRNA in As(2)O(3) -treated cells increased phospho-Wee1(Ser642) while decreased phospho-cdc2(Tyr15), resulting in decreased the G2/M cell cycle arrest. Therefore, induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest by As(2)O(3) involved upregulation of PTEN.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) continues to confound transplant surgeons and physicians. There are no effective methods to predict the patients at risk for recurrence so far although many studies have sought meaningful biomarkers. The ImmuKnow (IMK) assay is an immune cell function assay that detects cell-mediated immunity in an immunosuppressed population, mainly measuring peripheral blood CD4(+) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between cellular immune function measured by the ImmuKnow assay and HCC recurrence post-OLT. Methods: A total of 76 HCC cases underwent Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) liver transplant, which confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma by histology postoperatively. The ImmuKnow assay was prospectively performed in these cases at a range of 6-36 months post-OLT. Every test was repeated 1 week later, obtaining the average value for every patient. In addition, every case had liver imaging findings at approximately the exam time. Results: Fifteen cases with liver imaging findings showed HCC recurrence (19.7%) post-OLT, and the average ImmuKnow assay in these patients was 190 ± 48 ng/ml, which was less (p < 0.05) than in patients without HCC recurrence, whose average ATP level was 313 ± 90 ng/ml. ATP levels post-OLT were found to be significantly associated with the risk of tumour recurrence. The ratio of T reg cells and the levels of TGFβ and IL-10 were higher in recurrence patients than in recurrence-free patients. Conclusion: Greater suppression of cellular immunity, as measured by the ImmuKnow assay, was associated with progression of HCC recurrence post-OLT. ImmuKnow assay was helpful in determining the risk of early recurrence of HCC postliver transplant. A pathway consisting of T reg cells, TGFβ and IL-10 might be the HCC recurrence-predominant pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The p16INK4 (MTS1/CDNK2A) gene, located on chromosome 9p21, is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Various data have shown that it is frequently inactivated in several types of cell lines and primary human cancers. Materials and methods: Thirty cases with hepatocellular carcinoma were studied for possible p16INK4 gene mutation in Taiwan. Homozygous deletion was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The p16INK4 gene mutation was first screened by single strand conformation polymorphism, then direct DNA sequencing was performed on the cases with mobility shifts. Deletion mapping of chromosome 9p21-22 was also carried out with two polymorphic microsatellite markers (D9S925 and D9S168) using PCR. Results: One of the 30 cases had homozygous deletion at exon 3 of the p16INK4 gene. Another tumor had altered electrophoresed mobility in exon 2 with G to T transversion in the first nucleotide of codon 61 by direct sequencing causing a stop codon (GAG-->TAG). At the D9S925 and D9S168 loci, six out of 24 (25%) and three out of 19 (16%) informative cases showed loss of heterozygosity, respectively. Conclusion: Point mutation and homozygous deletion of the p16INK4 gene are present in a subset of hepatocellular carcinomas in Taiwan. The patterns of the p16INK4 gene alteration are, however, different from those from other regions. In addition, allelic loss on chromosome 9p21-22 is not an uncommon event in hepatocellular carcinomas. Therefore, the significance of chromosome 9p loss deserves to be extensively investigated.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Phyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae) species have long been used in folk medicine to treat various pathological conditions including liver diseases. Some species of Phyllanthus were found to exhibit hepatoprotective activity against drugs or toxins and this property was majorly attributed to phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin. In this study, we examined the hepatoprotective activity of five different species of Phyllanthus, namely, Phyllanthus amarus, Phyllanthus fraternus, Phyllanthus maderaspatensis, Phyllanthus urinaria, and Phyllanthus Rotundifolius. The extracts were also evaluated for the presence of key phytoconstituents, phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin. Materials and methods: The extracts were evaluated for hepatoprotective activity against tert-butyl hydroxide (t-BH)-induced cytotoxicity using human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2 cell line). Results: Only P. urinaria and P. maderaspatensis exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity as evident from increased cell viability. The HPLC profile revealed that except P. amarus, the other extracts did not contain phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin. Conclusion: P. urinaria and P. maderaspatensis demonstrated dose-dependent hepatoprotective activity and hence, can provide promising therapeutic interventions against chemical-induced liver damage.",

    "Abstract": "Rationale: Hydrochlorofluorocarbon 123 (HCFC-123, Freon123; 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) has been widely used in refrigeration and heat-transfer applications as a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons due to its lower ozone-depleting potentials. Occupational exposure to HCFC-123 may cause mild reversible hepatoxicity, but no fatal cases have been reported yet. Patient concerns: In this report, we present cases of severe hepatitis with fatal outcome by HCFC-123. Two industrial workers from a manufacturing factory of fire extinguishers which use HCFC-123 were presented with diarrhea, fever, myalgia, and jaundice. Patients had been repeatedly exposed to the liquid form of HCFC-123 for the past three weeks before flare of symptoms. Diagnosis: The blood biochemistry tests showed acute cholestatic hepatitis and liver biopsy findings indicated inflammatory hepatocellular injury. The diagnosis of HCFC-123 induced hepatitis was made. Interventions: The treatment for both patients were generally supportive. The second patient went through hemodialysis, ventilatory care, and artificial liver support therapy (molecular adsorbent recirculating system) at intensive care unit. Outcomes: One patient recovered uneventfully, whereas the other patient showed rapid deterioration leading to acute liver failure complicated with cerebral edema, subdural hemorrhage, and death on hospital day 10. Lessons: The HCFC-123-induced hepatitis showed similarities with halothane hepatitis, both of which may share pathophysiologic mechanisms. Exposure to HCFC-123 needs to be listed as a potential cause of acute liver failure, and to be considered in patients with acute hepatitis of uncertain etiology and negative viral serology.",

    "Abstract": "The interactions between transferrin (Tf) and transferrin receptor (Tfr) as they occur during biosynthesis were studied in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, which synthesizes both. Early during biosynthesis the Tfr monomer is converted to a disulfide-linked Tfr dimer. The Tfr monomer is not able to bind Tf, but Tf binding is observed as soon as the covalent Tfr dimer is formed and can take place in the ER. The Tf-Tfr complex is transported through the Golgi reticulum and trans-Golgi reticulum (TGR) and is ultimately delivered to an acidic compartment, where Tf releases its Fe3+. We did not observe conversion of Tf to apoTf in the TGR, showing that the part of the TGR passed by secreted Tf has a pH higher than 5.5. We conclude that when a ligand-receptor combination is synthesized by one and the same cell, ligand and receptor can interact during biosynthesis and be transported to the cell surface.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Treatment options are limited for patients with uterine serous carcinoma (USC). Knowledge of USC's somatic mutation landscape is rapidly increasing, but its role in hereditary cancers remains unclear. We aim to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of germline mutations in genes commonly implicated in carcinogenesis, including those within homologous recombination (HR) and mismatch repair (MMR) pathways in patients with pure USC. Methods: By using targeted capture exome sequencing, 43 genes were analyzed in a cohort of 7 consecutive patients with paired tumor and non-tumor USC samples in our institutional tumor repository. Mutations predicted to have damaging effects on protein function are validated by Sanger Sequencing. Results: We found 21 germline mutations in 11 genes in our USC cohort. Five patients harbored 7 germline mutations (33.3%) within genes involved in the HR pathway, RAD51D being the most common. Four patients had 9 (42.8%) germline mutations in hereditary colon cancer genes, most commonly MLH. All patients (42.7%) who are platinum-sensitive had HR germline mutations (RAD50, NBN, ATM). Patients with HER2 overexpression (2/7, 28.6%) had germline HR mutations and were platinum-sensitive. Three patients in our cohort reported a personal history of breast cancer, one with HR germline mutation, and 2 in patients with germline mutations in HCC genes. In addition, 5 out of 7 patients had germline mutations in genes associated with growth factor signaling pathway. Conclusions: A significant proportion of our cohort harbor germline mutations in DNA repair genes. This may be associated with the high rate of breast cancer in our patients and their family, and suggests a targeted cohort for genetic counseling. If validated in a larger cohort, our findings may allow clinicians to expand therapeutic options to include targeted therapies and inclusion of USC patient in preventative and genetic counseling.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Neddylation is a druggable and reversible ubiquitin-like post-translational modification upregulated in many diseases, including liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and more recently, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Herein, we propose to address the effects of neddylation inhibition and the underlying mechanisms in pre-clinical models of NAFLD. Methods: Hepatic neddylation measured by immunohistochemical analysis and NEDD8 serum levels measured by ELISA assay were evaluated in NAFLD clinical and pre-clinical samples. The effects of neddylation inhibition by using a pharmacological small inhibitor, MLN4924, or molecular approaches were assessed in isolated mouse hepatocytes and pre-clinical mouse models of diet-induced NAFLD, male adult C57BL/6 mice, and the AlfpCre transgenic mice infected with AAV-DIO-shNedd8. Results: Neddylation inhibition reduced lipid accumulation in oleic acid-stimulated mouse primary hepatocytes and ameliorated liver steatosis, preventing lipid peroxidation and inflammation in the mouse models of diet-induced NAFLD. Under these conditions, increased Deptor levels and the concomitant repression of mTOR signaling were associated with augmented fatty acid oxidation and reduced lipid content. Moreover, Deptor silencing in isolated mouse hepatocytes abolished the anti-steatotic effects mediated by neddylation inhibition. Finally, serum NEDD8 levels correlated with hepatic neddylation during the disease progression in the clinical and pre-clinical models CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the upregulation of Deptor, driven by neddylation inhibition, is proposed as a novel effective target and therapeutic approach to tackle NAFLD.",

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is the most common cause of HCC in many European countries, Japan and Pakistan. Introduction of the new direct acting antivirals (DAAs) has revolutionized the management of HCV worldwide, with high rates of sustained virologic response in patients who could not have tolerated the previous interferon based treatments. However, recently there have been reports raising caution about the long term effects of DAAs, particularly a possible increased risk of HCC. Therefore this review explores the current molecular studies as well as clinical data that investigate the impact of DAAs on occurrence and recurrence of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To construct and test a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-targeted magnetic resonance probe based on a glypican-3 (GPC3)-specific aptamer (AP613-1) with ultrasmall superpara-magnetic iron oxide (USPIO). Methods: Oleic acid-coated USPIO nanoparticles were modified with amino polyethylene glycol on the surface. Amino groups of the USPIO nanoparticles were reacted with the carboxyl group of 5' carboxyl-modified AP613-1, forming an aptamer-mediated USPIO (Apt-USPIO) probe. The material characterization of this probe including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, dynamic laser scattering, and magnetic behavior was carried out. The targeting efficiency and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance of Apt-USPIO were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo with USPIO alone as a control. The cytotoxicity and bio-compatibility of Apt-USPIO and USPIO were analyzed by cell counting kit-8 tests in vitro and animal experiments in vivo. Results: TEM imaging revealed that the Apt-USPIO nanoparticles were spherical in shape and well dispersed. Specific uptake of Apt-USPIO in Huh-7 cells could be observed using the Prussian blue staining test; however, no uptake of USPIO could be found. In vitro phantom T2-weighted MRI showed a significant decrease of the signal intensity in Apt-USPIO-incubated Huh-7 cells compared to USPIO-incubated Huh-7 cells. In vivo T2-weighted MRI showed significantly negative enhancement in the Huh-7 tumors enhanced with Apt-USPIO, whereas no enhancement was found with USPIO alone. Excellent biocompatibility of Apt-USPIO and USPIO was also demonstrated. Conclusion: In this study, a molecular MRI probe which was highly specific to GPC3 on HCC was successfully prepared. Our results validated the targeted imaging effect of this Apt-USPIO probe in vivo for GPC3-expressing HCCs in xenograft mice.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: To assess the outcomes of immediate LDT versus observation strategies for T1 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with respect to progression beyond Milan and survival. Method: T1 HCCs were retrospectively reviewed from a multidisciplinary tumour board database between September 2007 and May 2015. In the observation group, T1 lesions were observed until the tumour grew to meet T2 criteria (=2 cm). The treatment group consisted of T1 lesions treated at diagnosis with liver directed therapy (LDT). Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed for tumour progression beyond Milan and overall survival. Results: 87 patients (observation n=56; LDT n=31) were included in the study. A total of 22% (n=19) of patients progressed beyond Milan with no difference in progression between treatment and observation groups (19% vs 23%, p=0.49). Median time to progression beyond Milan was 16 months. Overall transplantation rate was 22% (observation group n=16; treatment group n=3, p=0.04). Median survival was 55 months with LDT versus 36 months in the observation group (p=0.22). In patients who progressed to T2 (n=60), longer time to T2 progression was a predictor of improved survival (HR=0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99, p=0.03). Conclusions: Immediate LDT of T1 lesions was not associated with increased risk of progression beyond Milan criteria when compared with an observation approach. Longer time to T2 progression was associated with increased survival and may be a surrogate for favourable tumour biology.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/aims: There are few guidelines for tailored immunosuppressive regimens for liver transplantation (LT) recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To establish long-term immunosuppressive regimens suitable for Korean adult LT recipients, we analyzed those that were currently in use at a single high-volume institution. Methods: This cross-sectional study comprises three parts including review of the immunosuppressive regimens used to manage 2,147 adult LT outpatients, review of LT recipients who were diagnosed of HCC at LT, and review of LT recipients who suffered from HCC recurrence. Results: In 1,000 adult LT recipients who were living more than 5 years with no adverse events, 916 received a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based therapy (CNI only in 520; CNI with mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] in 396) and 84 were receiving an MMF-based therapy (MMF only in 45; MMF with minimal CNI in 39). Tacrolimus was preferred over cyclosporine for both monotherapy and combination therapy along the passage of posttransplant period. There was no difference in selection of immunosuppressants, target blood concentration, and rate of combination therapy between LT recipients with and without HCC, except for the first 1 year. Sirolimus-based regimens were applied in 21 patients who showed HCC recurrence. Sorafenib was often used after conversion to sirolimus. Conclusions: Tailored immunosuppressive regimen covering the long-term posttransplant period should be established after consideration of individualized patient profiles including HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The risk difference between multiphase multidetector contrast-enhanced CT and MRI for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been previously evaluated in patients with cirrhosis undergoing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance. We aimed to compare the rate of AKI after CT and MRI for evaluation of these lesions. Design: A retrospective chart review of all patients with cirrhosis who underwent either multiphase multidetector liver protocol CT or MRI for lesions detected on HCC screening was conducted at West Virginia University. The rate of AKI after imaging was compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 416 patients were included. Hepatitis C was the most common aetiology (34.6%) of cirrhosis. Thirty-six patients had chronic kidney disease at the time of imaging. CT imaging was conducted for 173 (41.5%) patients, while 58.5% underwent MRI. Nineteen (4.6%) patients developed AKI after imaging. The incidence of AKI was 2.89% for CT and 5.76% for MRI (p value = 0.25). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that inpatient status (p value = 0.015) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (p value = 0.02) were independently linked to the development of AKI following imaging, while the type of imaging modality was not. Conclusions: There is no difference in the risk of AKI after CT or MRI for evaluation of lesions identified on HCC surveillance. The rates of AKI after these imaging studies are low and are attributable to other aetiologies in most cases. We propose that the choice of imaging should be made based on availability, cost, and other patient-related and facility-related factors.",

We constructed a microsimulation model with Markov chains for NAFLD (including steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)), body mass index, T2D and CHD. We assessed reductions in population disease prevalence, disease-attributable disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and costs, with interventions that reduce added sugars consumption by either 20% or 50%. Findings: The model estimated that a 20% reduction in added sugars intake will reduce prevalence of hepatic steatosis, NASH, cirrhosis, HCC, obesity, T2D and CHD. Incidence of T2D and CHD would be expected to decrease by 19.9 (95% CI 12.8 to 27.0) and 9.4 (95% CI 3.1 to 15.8) cases per 100 000 people after 20 years, respectively. A 20% reduction in consumption is also projected to annually avert 0.767 million (M) DALYs (95% CI 0.757M to 0.777M) and a total of US$10.3 billion (B) (95% CI 10.2B to 10.4B) in discounted direct medical costs by 2035. These effects increased proportionally when added sugars intake were reduced by 50%. Conclusions: The decrease in incidence and prevalence of disease is similar to results in other models, but averted costs and DALYs were higher, mainly due to inclusion of NAFLD and CHD. The model suggests that efforts to reduce consumption of added sugars may result in significant public health and economic benefits.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The objective of this was to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins that are associated with risk of human cancer. Methods: First, 45 SNPs in CDKs and cyclins were analyzed in 106 lung cancers and 108 controls for a pilot study. One SNP (reference SNP [rs] 769236, +1 guanine to adenine [G→A]) at the promoter region of cyclin A2 (CCNA2) also was analyzed in 1989 cancers (300 breast cancers, 450 colorectal cancers, 450 gastric cancers, 367 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 422 lung cancers) and in 1096 controls. Genotyping was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Transcriptional activity of the SNP according to the cell cycle was analyzed by using a luciferase reporter assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in NIH3T3 cells. Results: In the pilot study, the SNP (rs769236) was associated significantly with the risk of lung cancer. In the expanded study, multivariate logistic regression indicated that the AA homozygous variant of the SNP was associated significantly with the development of lung cancer (P < .0001; codominant model), colorectal cancer (P < .0001), and hepatocellular carcinoma (P = .02) but not with breast cancer or gastric cancer. The luciferase activity of a 300-base pair construct that contained the A allele was 1.5-fold greater than the activity of a construct with the G allele in NIH3T3 cells. The high luciferase activity of constructs that contained the A allele did not change with cell cycle progression. Conclusions: The current results suggested that an SNP (rs769236) at the promoter of CCNA2 may be associated significantly with increased risk of colon, liver, and lung cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Background: E-cadherin is an epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and decreased E-cadherin expression in liver cancer is associated with poor prognosis. A -160 C-->A polymorphism in the promoter region of E-cadherin has been reported to decrease gene transcription. This allelic variation may be a potential genetic marker for identifying those individuals at higher risk for invasive/metastatic disease. Methods: The effect of E-cadherin gene polymorphism on risk of tumor recurrence was studied in 93 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation, and determined whether this polymorphism is a biomarker for the risk of tumor recurrence. Results: The genotype frequencies in the patients with recurrence were C/C: 0.667, C/A: 0.311, and A/A: 0.022, and in the patients without recurrence C/C: 0.604, C/A: 0.271 and A/A: 0.125. No significant difference was found between the two groups (P=0.171). Between -160 C-->A polymorphism and the clinicopathological data, there were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of the parameters as to age, gender, portal vein tumor thrombi, preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor size, or histopathological grading (P>0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study show no association exists between the E-cadherin genotype and the risk of tumor recurrence in Chinese patients with HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents one of the highest incidences of cancers worldwide. Phosphatidylinositol glycan, class K (PIGK), is a crucial member of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol transamidase (GPIT) protein complex that attaches a diverse group of macromolecules to the plasma membrane of eukaryotes. However, the precise role of PIGK in tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Recently, we reported low expression of PIGK protein in primary tumors compared to paired normal tissues of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. To understand the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we performed sequencing of all 10 exons of the PIGK gene in 45 CRC patients. Corresponding PIGK protein expression was also evaluated in these patients by immunohistochemistry. No mutation was detected in the coding regions, however, we found a single nucleotide polymorphism (C/C→C/G or G/G; rs1048575) in the 3'UTR of the PIGK gene in 67% (30/45) of the patients. Most of the patients (22/26, 85%) with the altered alleles were of Jewish origin. In comparison, 47% (8/17) of the Arabian patients exhibited the altered C/G alleles. We observed a significantly low (p<0.002) expression of PIGK protein in the patients with the altered alleles (C/G or G/G) compared to the ancestral alleles (C/C). Similarly to the CRC patients, we also examined 5 HCC patients and two HCC cell lines (Hep3B and HepG2) for PIGK genotype (SNP-1048575) and corresponding protein expression. We observed altered alleles (C/G or G/G) and corresponding low PIGK protein expression in 4 out of 5 (80%) primary HCC tumors. Among the HCC cell lines, HepG2 line exhibited ancestral C/C alleles, whereas Hep3B showed altered C/G alleles. Similar to the HCC patients, Hep3B line with the altered alleles (C/G) exhibited significantly low (Student's t-test, p<0.002) PIGK protein expression compared to the Hep3B line carrying the ancestral (C/C) alleles. To examine the exogenous PIGK protein expression status, we transiently transfected both HepG2 (C/C alleles) and Hep3B (C/G alleles) cell lines with wt-PIGK constructs. We detected exogenously expressed PIGK protein in HepG2 (C/C) cells, but no PIGK expression was detectable in Hep3B (C/G) cells at either mRNA or protein level. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, a link between the SNP 1048575 and low PIGK expression in CRC/HCC patients and also suggest a possible association between altered PIGK expression and disease susceptibility.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the safety of high dose hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of liver volumetric changes and clinical liver function. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 16 patients with small HCC who were treated with high dose hypofractionated RT between 2006 and 2009. The serial changes of the liver volumetric parameter were analyzed from pre-RT and follow-up (FU) computed tomography (CT) scans. We estimated linear time trends of whole liver volume using a linear mixed model. The serial changes of the Child-Pugh (CP) scores were also analyzed in relation to the volumetric changes. Results: Mean pre-RT volume of entire liver was 1,192.2 mL (range, 502.6 to 1,310.2 mL) and mean clinical target volume was 14.7 mL (range, 1.56 to 70.07 mL). Fourteen (87.5%) patients had 4 FU CT sets and 2 (12.5%) patients had 3 FU CT sets. Mean interval between FU CT acquisition was 2.5 months. After considering age, gender and the irradiated liver volume as a fixed effects, the mixed model analysis confirmed that the change in liver volume is not significant throughout the time course of FU periods. Majority of patients had a CP score change less than 2 except in 1 patient who had CP score change more than 3. Conclusion: The high dose hypofractionated RT for small HCC is relatively safe and feasible in terms of liver volumetric changes and clinical liver function.",

    "Abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor and its negative regulator, murine double minute 2 (MDM2), play critical roles in carcinogenesis. P53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G polymorphisms could influence p53 and MDM2 function, respectively, and might affect cancer susceptibility. We therefore investigated the association between these two SNPs, alone or in combination, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese. In this case-control study, we genotyped p53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G polymorphisms in 985 HCC cases and 992 cancer-free age- and sex-matched controls and evaluated their associations with the risk of HCC. Although no significant main effects were found for these two SNPs in the single-locus analysis and stratified analysis by age, sex, smoking, drinking, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, we found that individuals carrying at least one G allele of the MDM2 309T>G polymorphism had statistically significant increased risk of HCC among those with the p53 Pro/Pro genotype (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.23, 95 % confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.20-4.14 for TG genotype; adjusted OR = 2.67, 95%CI = 1.32-5.42 for GG genotype), and the interaction between p53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G was significant (P interaction = 0.017). Our findings suggest that the interaction of p53 codon 72 and MDM2 309T>G may play an important role in the etiology of HCC. More studies with well-designed and large sample sizes are required to validate these observations.",

The MDM2-p53 feedback loop plays an important role in tumor progression and thus, increased understanding of the pathway has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for cancer patients. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has emerged as one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of human cancer; yet, the current treatment for HCC is less effective than those used against other cancers. We review the current studies of the MDM2-p53 pathway in cancer with a focus on HCC and specifically discuss the impact of p53 mutations along with other alterations of the MDM2-p53 feedback loop in HCC. We also discuss the potential diagnostic and prognostic applications of p53 and MDM2 in malignant tumors as well as therapeutic avenues that are being developed to target the MDM2-p53 pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of vascular lake (VL), its associated factors and correlation with prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE). Patients and methods: A total of 286 primary HCC patients (with 384 treated nodules) receiving DEB-TACE treatment were recruited, and their clinical characteristics were documented. The occurrence of VL was recorded, and treatment responses were assessed according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (mRECIST).In terms of treatment response, the total response status (including CR, PR, SD and PD), objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were elevated in VL patients compared to non-VL patients as well as in VL nodules compared to non-VL nodules. Liver function indexes and adverse events were assessed. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with the last follow-up date of March 2020. Results: The patient-based and nodule-based VL occurrence rates were 17.1% and 16.4%, respectively. Larger tumor size, pseudocapsules and smaller bead size were independently associated with VL occurrence. PFS and OS were more prolonged in VL patients than in non-VL patients, and VL independently correlated with better PFS and OS. For liver function, the liver function indexes before and after DEB-TACE were of no difference between VL patients and non-VL patients. Additionally, the incidences of adverse events were similar between VL patients and non-VL patients. Conclusion: VL occurs in 17.1% of HCC patients treated with DEB-TACE, and it is correlated with larger tumor size, pseudocapsule, smaller bead size, more favorable treatment response and better survival.",

    "Abstract": "Loss of chromosome arm 18q is a common event in human pancreatic, colon, and breast cancers and is often interpreted as representing loss of one or more tumor-suppressor genes. In this article, we describe two novel biallelic deletions at chromosome band 18q21.1 in a recently characterized human breast cancer cell line, HCC-1428. One lesion deletes a fragment of approximately 300 kb between SMAD4 and DCC that encodes no known genes. The second lesion is an in-frame SMAD4 deletion (amino acids 49-51) that affects the level of SMAD4 protein but not the SMAD4 message. This change accelerates 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of both endogenous and exogenous mutant SMAD4. Examination of normal DNA from the same patient demonstrated that both lesions are somatic and associated with loss of both normal alleles. These data support the concept that two independent tumor-suppressor loci exist at chromosome segment 18q21.1, one at SMAD4 and the other potentially at an enhancer of DCC or an unrelated novel gene.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Interleukin-16 (IL16) as a multifunctional cytokine, plays a key role in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as tumour growth and progression. Recently, genetic polymorphisms of IL16 have been reported to be associated with susceptibility to a range of cancers. This study was undertaken to investigate the IL16 gene polymorphisms and determine whether these genetic factors are related to the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Chinese population. Methods: We analyzed three polymorphisms of the IL16 gene (rs11556218T/G, rs4072111C/T and rs4778889T/C) in 206 patients with HBV-related HCC, 270 chronic hepatitis B patients and 264 healthy controls, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and DNA sequencing technology. Results: IL16 polymorphisms were not associated with risk of HCC when compared with healthy controls. However, IL16 polymorphisms were significantly associated with susceptibility to HBV-related HCC when using chronic hepatitis B patients as controls. The rs11556218T/G TG and GG genotypes were associated with significantly increased risk of HBV-related HCC compared with the TT genotype (OR = 1.96 and OR = 3.33). The data also revealed that subjects with the G allele appeared to have higher susceptibility to HBV-related HCC than those with the T allele (OR = 2.10). Under the dominant model genotype TG+GG appeared to be associated with an increased risk of HBV-related HCC (OR = 2.18). The rs4072111C/T TT genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of HBV-related HCC compared with the CC genotype (OR = 6.67). Polymorphisms of the IL16 gene were significantly associated with susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B when using healthy subjects as controls. The rs11556218T/G TG and GG genotypes were associated with significantly decreased risk of chronic hepatitis B compared with the TT genotype (OR = 0.49 and OR = 0.29). The data also revealed that subjects with the G allele appeared to have lower susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B than those with the T allele (OR = 0.46). Under the dominant model genotype TG + GG appeared to have lower susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B (OR = 0.44). Conclusions: This study showed that the genotypes and allele of IL16 SNPs were associated with chronic HBV infection and HCC. However, further investigation with a larger sample size and haplotype analysis with other SNPs may be required to validate the genetic effects of the IL16 polymorphisms on chronic HBV infection and HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Transaldolase (TAL) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) that generates NADPH for protection against oxidative stress. While deficiency of other PPP enzymes, such as transketolase (TKT), are incompatible with mammalian cell survival, mice lacking TAL are viable and develop progressive liver disease attributed to oxidative stress. Mice with homozygous or heterozygous TAL deficiency are predisposed to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver failure. Both mice and humans with complete TAL deficiency accumulate sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P). Previous human studies relied on screening patients with S7P accumulation, thus excluding potentially pathogenic haploinsufficiency. Of note, mice with TAL haploinsufficiency are also predisposed to HCC and APAP-induced liver failure which are preventable with oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration. Based on TALDO1 DNA sequencing, we detected functional TAL deficiency due to novel, heterozygous variations in two of 94 healthy adults and four of 27 subjects with APAP-induced liver failure (P = .022). The functional consequences of these variations were individually validated by site-directed mutagenesis of normal cDNA and loss of activity by recombinant enzyme. All four patients with TAL haplo-insufficiency with APAP-induced liver failure were successfully treated with NAC. We also document two novel variations in two of 15 children with previously unexplained liver cirrhosis. Examination of the National Center for Biotechnology Information databases revealed 274 coding region variations have been documented in 1125 TALDO1 sequences relative to 25 variations in 2870 TKT sequences (P < .0001). These findings suggest an unexpected prevalence and variety of genetic changes in human TALDO1 with relevance for liver injury that may be preventable by treatment with NAC.",

After failing to identify a diagnosis after routine metabolic evaluation, we utilized a combination of RNA-Seq and whole exome sequencing to identify a novel homozygous p.Ser171Phe Transaldolase (TALDO1) variant in the proband, his brother with cirrhosis, as well as a clinically asymptomatic older 8-year-old brother. Metabolite analysis and enzymatic testing of TALDO1 demonstrated elevated ribitol, sedoheptitol, and sedoheptulose-7P, and lack of activity of TALDO1 in the three children homozygous for the p.Ser171Phe mutation. Our findings expand the phenotype of transaldolase deficiency to include early onset hepatocellular carcinoma in humans and demonstrate that, even within the same family, individuals with the same homozygous mutation demonstrate a wide range of phenotypes.",

    "Abstract": "Transaldolase deficiency (MIM#: 606003) is a rare autosomal recessive defect in the pentose phosphate pathway. Affected individuals are at risk for progressive liver failure and hepatocarcinoma. In the transaldolase-deficient mouse model (Taldo1 -/-), these hepatic complications are accentuated by oxidative stress related to acetaminophen administration. We report a 13-month-old transaldolase-deficient male who developed mild liver failure after receiving standard doses of acetaminophen during a febrile respiratory syncytial virus infection. He was admitted for respiratory distress with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, but developed an enlarged nodular liver with accompanying splenomegaly and rising alpha-fetoprotein which peaked 2 weeks after acetaminophen exposure. Whole exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants c.512_514delCCT (p.Ser171del) and c.931G > T (p.Gly311Trp) in TALDO1 (HGNC:11559), which encodes transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2), a key enzyme in ribose metabolism. Urine polyols and plasma metabolomics confirmed the diagnosis of transaldolase deficiency. Studies on the Taldo1 -/- mouse model demonstrate acetaminophen-induced liver failure can be prevented by administration of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Moreover, a published report showed treatment of a transaldolase-deficient patient with N-acetylcysteine was associated with a decrease in alpha-fetoprotein levels. After discontinuation of acetaminophen and prior to initiation of N-acetylcysteine treatment, our patient demonstrated resolving alpha-fetoprotein levels suggesting acetaminophen incited the liver failure. Conclusion: Our observations support the conclusion from mouse model studies that transaldolase-deficient patients are uniquely sensitive to acetaminophen and should avoid this antipyretic. Recognition of this individualized toxicity and avoidance of acetaminophen are essential for management of these patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is used as an alternative ablative treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not suitable for curative treatments. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of SBRT for small (≤5 cm) HCCs. Methods: A phase II, single-arm clinical trial on SBRT for small HCCs was conducted at an academic tertiary care center. The planned SBRT dose was 45 Gy with a fraction size of 15-Gy over 3 consecutive days. The primary endpoint was 2-year local control rate. Radiologic responses were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) and the modified RECIST criteria. Results: Between 2013 and 2016, 50 patients (53 lesions) were enrolled, with a median follow-up period of 47.8 months (range, 2.9-70.6). Patients' age ranged from 41 to 74 years, and 80% were male. Median tumor size was 1.3 cm (range, 0.7-3.1). The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 100% and 97.1%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rate was 77.6%. Six months after SBRT, radiologic responses were evident in 44 lesions (83%) according to the RECIST criteria and 49 (92.4%) according to the modified RECIST criteria. None of the patients showed grade ≥3 adverse events. Conclusion: SBRT showed excellent results as an ablative treatment for patients with small HCCs while showing minimal toxicities. SBRT can be a good alternative for both curative and salvage intents in patients with HCCs that are unsuitable for curative treatments.",

Here, we present the first reported case of HCC in a 60-year-old female patient with Cowden syndrome. We diagnosed the patient using a pathognomonic criterion of the International Cowden Consortium Operational Diagnostic Criteria and performed genetic analysis. Enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a hypervascular tumor in segment VII of the liver. The patient was diagnosed with Cowden syndrome because her mucocutaneous lesions met the pathognomonic criterion. Mutational analysis confirmed a heterozygous germ line TGT→TAT transition at nucleotide 407 in exon 5 of the phosphatase and tensin homolog detected on the chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene. Needle biopsy showed a poorly differentiated HCC. We also diagnosed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from hepatic histological findings of Mallory's bodies and ballooning cells. PTEN-deficient mice reportedly develop HCC through NASH. This is the first reported case of Cowden syndrome complicated with HCC possibly originating from NASH.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The INK4a/ARF locus encodes p16INK4a and p14ARF, both of which are crucial for two tumor suppressor pathways, retinoblastoma (RB)/p16INK4a and p53/ARF. Inactivation of RB/p16INK4a was frequently reported, but alterations of the p14ARF gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Japanese population have been insufficiently analyzed. Methods: To determine the role of p53/ARF alteration in hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined 44 HCCs for mRNA expression, deletion, mutation, and promoter hypermethylation of the p14(ARF) gene; alterations of p53 were also analyzed in the same series of HCCs. Results: Homozygous deletion, spanning from exon 1 beta to exon 2, was found in 1 HCC mutations within exon 2 were found in 2 HCCs, but no promoter hypermethylation was detected. All 3 HCCs with p14(ARF) alteration were well differentiated. Twelve of the 44 HCCs (27.2%) showed immunohistochemical evidence of p53 alteration; however, only 1 of the tumors with p53 alteration was well differentiated. TaqMan polymarase chain reaction (PCR) indicated that the expression of p14(ARF) in HCCs was higher than in that in all but three of the corresponding non-tumorous tissues ( P < 0.0001), and increased expression of p14(ARF) seemed to be associated with poorly differentiated phenotype. Absence of p14(ARF) expression was seen in only one HCC, with homozygous deletion of the p14(ARF) gene. Conclusions: Compared with p53 alteration, p14(ARF) alteration does not occur frequently, but may play a role in a subset of Japanese HCCs in the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis. On the other hand, overexpression of p14(ARF) was frequently observed in HCC, especially in poorly differentiated tumors, probably reflecting oncogenic stimuli in these tumors. The INK4a/ARF locus encodes p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), both of which are crucial for two tumor suppressor pathways, retinoblastoma (RB)/p16(INK4a) and p53/ARF. Inactivation of RB/p16(INK4a) was frequently reported, but alterations of the p14(ARF) gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Japanese population have been insufficiently analyzed.",

This was done in order to ascertain whether the tumors were synchronous endometrial/ovarian cancers or an advanced metastatic stage from either the ovary or the uterus. Pathologic criteria favoured synchronous EC/OC. We identified a PTEN c.959 T > G (p.L320X) truncating mutation occurring with similar allele frequency in both neoplastic tissues (ovary: 88 %, endometrium 89 %) and a CTNNB1 c.100C > G (p.S37C) activating mutation, with a comparable allelic frequency in both tumor tissues (ovary 51 %, endometrium 52 %). The shared genetic mutations, and the presence of PTEN c.959 T > G (p.L320X) truncating mutation, albeit at low allelic frequency (6 %), in the healthy peritumoral endometrial tissue, appear to confirm the recent literature on a primary endometrial origin for synchronous EC/OC. A third mutation was CTNNB1 c.92 T > C (p.L31 P), a missense mutation occurring with a low allele frequency (3.7 %) only in the ovarian cancer tissue. This mutation is only occasionally described in hepatocellular carcinomas.",

    "Abstract": "Sorafenib has been demonstrated to be a beneficial treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Emerging evidence indicates that caspase-1 activation plays a crucial role in HCC progression. However, the relationship between caspase-1 and sorafenib has rarely been reported. In this study, we showed that caspase-1 was essential for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, sorafenib treatment could inhibit LPS-stimulated caspase-1 overexpression through restricting the nuclear transport of p65, which contributed to inactivation of NF-κB. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments and immunoblot analysis indicated that sorafenib treatment decreased the SUMOylation of p65 via inhibiting TLR4/stat3/SUMO1 signaling cascades. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that sorafenib inhibits caspase-1 expression through suppressing the nuclear translocation of p65 and provide new insights into the mechanisms of sorafenib treatment in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Primary hepatic tumors mainly include hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Thus far, HCC prognosis has remained extremely poor given the lack of effective treatments. Numerous studies have described the roles played by microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer progression and the potential of these small noncoding RNAs for diagnostic or therapeutic applications. The current consensus supports the idea that direct repression of a wide range of oncogenes by a single key miRNA could critically affect the malignant properties of cancer cells in a synergistic manner. In this study, we aimed to investigate the oncogenes controlled by miR-493-5p, a major tumor suppressor miRNA that inactivates miR-483-3p oncomir in hepatic cancer cells. Using global gene expression analysis, we highlighted a set of candidate genes potentially regulated by miR-493-5p. In particular, the canonical MYCN protooncogene (MYCN) appeared to be an attractive target of miR-493-5p given its significant inhibition through 3'-UTR targeting in miR-493-5p-rescued HCC cells. We showed that MYCN was overexpressed in liver cancer cell lines and clinical samples from HCC patients. Notably, MYCN expression levels were inversely correlated with miR-493-5p in tumor tissues. We confirmed that MYCN knockdown mimicked the anticancer effect of miR-493-5p by inhibiting HCC cell growth and invasion, whereas MYCN rescue hindered miR-493-5p activity. In summary, miR-493-5p is a pivotal miRNA that modulates various oncogenes after its reexpression in liver cancer cells, suggesting that tumor suppressor miRNAs with a large spectrum of action could provide valuable tools for miRNA replacement therapies.",

Method: The study enrolled 87 patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of 38 hepatocellular carcinomas, 33 hepatic hemangiomas, 30 metastatic liver tumors, and 14 hepatic cysts. PSIR was performed before and 15 min after contrast agent administration, and then the respective T1 values were measured and the T1 reduction rate was calculated. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to compare T1 values pre- and post-contrast administration in each tumor. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc test were used to compare T1 values among all tumors pre- and post-contrast administration and the T1 reduction rate among all tumors. Results: The T1 values measured before and after contrast enhancement were 1056 ± 292 ms and 724 ± 199 ms for hepatocellular carcinoma, 1757 ± 723 ms and 1033 ± 406 ms for metastatic liver tumor, 2524 ± 908 ms and 1071 ± 390 ms for hepatic hemangioma, and 3793 ± 207 ms and 3671 ± 241 ms for liver cysts, respectively. The T1 values obtained before and after contrast administration showed significant differences for all tumors except liver cysts (P < 0.0001). T1 reduction rate was not significantly different between hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver tumor, but was significantly different among other tumors (P < 0.05). Conclusions: T1 mapping using the PSIR sequence is useful to differentiate focal liver lesions.",

This assay enables the researcher to score wild-type p53 expression on the basis of the ability of expressed p53 to transactivate the reporter gene HIS 3 via the p53-responsive GAL 1 promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cell lines examined were ten hepatoma, two hepatoblastoma, three in vitro immortalized fibroblast, two osteosarcoma, a chondrosarcoma, an ovarian teratocarcinoma and a colon cancer cell line. Out of 20 cell lines, 11 cell lines had mutations in both alleles of the p53 gene, and another 8 cell lines had no mutation in the p53 gene. Thus, 55% of the cell lines examined had mutations in the p53. Interestingly, PA-1 cells had both the normal and the mutant p53 alleles, showing that FASAY is a useful method for detecting the wild-type and mutated p53 genes simultaneously. As for the three liver cell lines harboring HBsAg, there was no relationship between their p53 gene status and the presence of HBsAg. Two cell lines were normal for p53 status, while the other had a mutation of the p53 gene.",

Methods: Twenty-five patients (median age, 48 years [24 to 65 years]; M:F=18:7) with suspected P. multiflorum Thunb-induced liver injury were admitted to our hospital between 2007 and 2009. We analyzed clinical and histological data, including the types and the duration of P. multiflorum Thunb intake and the duration of hospital care. We also determined the type of liver injury using the R ratio (serum activity of ALT/serum activity of ALP). Results: The types of complementary medicine used included tea (n=16), liquor (n=5), tea and liquor (n=2), powder (n=1), and honeyed pudding (n=1). The most common presenting sign was jaundice (76%), and 18 patients (72%) had evidence of hepatocellular liver injury. Histological findings were consistent with acute hepatitis in all cases (n=10) for which liver biopsy was performed. Twenty-three patients (91.6%) recovered with conservative management, 1 patient (4%) had a liver transplant, and 1 patient (4%) died of hepatic failure. Conclusions: In our cases, we found that P. multiflorum Thunb could be hepatotoxic and could lead to severe drug-induced liver injury, and even death.",

    "Abstract": "The structural abnormalities of the p53 gene have frequently been detected in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). To ascertain whether or not functional inactivation of this gene also occurs in HCCs, the transactivation of p53 gene products in 11 HCC cell lines maintained in our laboratory and 26 HCC surgical specimens was examined by yeast functional assay (functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast: FASAY), which determines the functional status of the individual p53 alleles. The p53 gene product was inactivated in 8 of 11 (72.7%) HCC cell lines and in 12 of 26 (46.2%) HCC surgical specimens. The inactivation frequency of the gene was 37.5%, 36.4%, and 71.4% in well, moderately, and poorly differentiated HCCs, respectively. In HCC surgical specimens larger than 5 cm in diameter, the inactivation frequency was 83.3% while in those smaller than 2. 5 cm, it was 14.3%. These results show that functional inactivation of p53 gene products often occurs in HCCs and that the inactivation frequency of the gene in HCCs is well correlated with differentiation degree and tumor size, suggesting that the inactivation of p53 gene products plays a role in progression from well to poorly differentiated HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Transcriptional slippage was previously found in Escherichia coli during RNA elongation at runs of 10 or more As or Ts, resulting in the addition of untemplated A or U residues. To evaluate the incidence of transcriptional slippage in vivo, we employed a yeast functional assay, and analyzed the frequency and spectrum of mutations in mRNA of the tumor suppressor p53 in rat tissues. In this assay, yeast are transfected with p53 PCR products and a gapped p53 expression vector, which allow homologous recombination in vivo and yield a percentage of red colonies which reflects the proportion of mutant PCR products. Insertion mutations of single base of adenine (A) at stretches of 6 As were frequently detected in the liver samples of LEC rats which develop spontaneous hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. For excluding the possibility of artifacts involvement, p53 cDNA was amplified by PCR from plasmids containing wild-type p53 and tested with the yeast functional assay, which resulted in no A insertion after sequencing 23 mutant clones. Furthermore, in vitro transcript of wild-type p53 was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase, and then, reverse-transcribed, PCR-amplified, and tested with the yeast functional assay. The overall rate of A insertion was much lower than that in the LEC rat liver. Since A insertions were found predominantly at nucleotides 293-298 in exon 4, an exon 4-specific yeast functional assay was developed. A insertion was detected in 4.8% of the PCR product of mRNA but 0-0.1% from genomic DNA, which suggested that such A insertion was caused by transcriptional slippage in vivo. The A insertion rate abruptly increased in acute hepatitis stage in the LEC rat liver, while the rate slowly increased by aging in control WKAH rat liver. It was suggested that cell damage and aging were primarily responsible for the increased rate of transcriptional slippage.",

    "Abstract": "We studied the transcriptional activity of p53 protein in 50 tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a yeast functional assay. In this assay, red yeast colonies indicate that p53 protein cannot bind to its specific domain and has lost its transcriptional activity. We also clarified whether mutant p53 protein could inactivate wild-type p53 protein in a transdominant manner using a modified yeast assay. In addition, we examined whether immunohistochemically detectable p53 protein was functionally inactive. The incidence of p53 inactivation was significantly higher in tumors with capsular invasion. Out of 21 tumors diagnosed with p53 mutations, 11 exhibited >75% red colonies, and all contained missense mutations. In these tumors, p53 function was lost because there was supposedly no intact p53 gene on either allele. One missense mutant produced <60% red colonies, but it was also considered inactive as a p53 protein heterotetramer because of its transdominant activity. In 7 of the remaining 9 tumors, p53 was considered to be mutated on one allele and intact on the other. All of these 7 tumors contained nonsense or frameshift mutations and had no transdominant activity, which suggested that p53 function remained intact. Alternately, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that all of the tumors with missense mutations were positively immunostained, whereas those that contained nonsense or frameshift mutations were negatively stained. Consequently, positively immunostaining tumors mostly coincided with p53-inactive tumors. These yeast-based assays suggested that p53 function was retained in some mutant cases. Immunohistochemistry was helpful in screening functionally inactive p53 protein in HCCs.",

    "Abstract": "An albumin-simian virus 40 (SV40) large T-antigen (T-Ag) transgenic model and a chemically induced model of multistage hepatocarcinogenesis were created in our laboratory to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the genesis and progression of neoplasia in the rat liver. In the study presented here, these two models of rat hepatocarcinogenesis were used to perform a comparative mutational analysis of three tumor suppressor genes involved in hepatic neoplastic growth. By using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing, exons 5-8 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and a region between nt 4325 and 4479 of the rat mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6p/Igf2r) coding sequence were screened. The latter is homologous to the human M6P/IGF2r coding sequence which is mutated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. A complete single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the entire coding region of the rat adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene was also performed for the first time in rat tumorigenic samples. Twenty-six chemically induced rat hepatocellular carcinomas, 21 neoplasms from the livers of SV40 T-Ag animals, and five immortalized hepatic cell lines from the transgenic rats were evaluated. None of the hepatic tumors exhibited mutations in the regions analyzed. The albumin-SV40 T-Ag transgenic cell line L-60, derived from normal hepatic tissue, had two mutations in contiguous codons of exon 5 of the p53 gene: a GGT --> GTT missense transversion in codon 183 and a silent mutation in codon 184. The transversion, which may affect the DNA binding domain of the p53 protein, probably originated during cell culture and may have been positively selected because it gave a growth advantage to the mutated cells. The studied region of the M6p/Igf2r gene was not found to be mutated in these two models of rat hepatocarcinogenesis. Although M6p/Igf2r, Apc, and p53 have been shown to be mutated in a variety of human hepatic proliferative diseases, our results indicate that aberrations in these genes may not be necessary for liver carcinogenesis in the rat.",

To define the possible role of mutations of the APC gene in hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined 46 pairs of hepatocellular carcinomas and corresponding non-tumorous liver tissue by polymerase chain reaction and single strand conformation polymorphism. All 46 hepatocellular carcinomas had no altered electrophoretic mobility to suggest the presence of APC gene mutation in the mutation cluster region. We also examined the possible loss of heterozygosity of APC and MCC gene loci by fragment length polymorphism analysis and by polymerase chain reaction. None of the cases showed a loss of heterozygosity at the APC and MCC gene loci. The results suggested that the possibility of APC and MCC as the gene defect in the genesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma may be very rare.",

    "Abstract": "We have examined p53 oncogene/anti-oncogene alleles in 10 different human hepatoma cell lines and 18 primary hepatocellular carcinomas. The p53 allele in these hepatoma cell lines appears to be a frequent target of mutation as demonstrated by Southern and Northern blotting, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. In general, the steady state level of p53 specific RNA or protein in these hepatoma cell lines is higher than in normal liver. However, in three out of ten cell lines, normal-sized p53 mRNA cannot be detected. In contrast, the involvement of the p53 allele in primary hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be an exceedingly rare event. Steady state levels of p53 specific RNA in primary hepatomas are practically indistinguishable from those in normal adult liver. Using the polymerase chain reaction technique, we have amplified and subcloned exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 of p53 from 10 different hepatoma samples. DNA sequence analysis of these exon subclones reveals no apparent structural alterations. Finally, synthesis of p53 specific mRNA or protein in a HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cell line does not appear to be affected by gene expression and replication of human hepatitus B virus. Surprisingly, unlike many other kinds of human solid tumors, point mutations in p53 do not appear to be important in primary tumors of hepatocellular carcinomas.",

    "Abstract": "A G:C-->T:A mutational hotspot at codon 249 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has previously been identified in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of patients from Qidong, China and southern Africa in which aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are known synergistic risk factors. We have examined p53 mutation patterns of HCC from geographic areas in which the risk factors vary. Nine HCC lines and four hepatoblastoma lines (HB) were examined for p53 gene mutations and the relationship with HBV infection. Five of the nine HCC lines had homozygous mutation or deletion randomly distributed in exons 6-8, whereas none of the four HB cell lines had p53 mutations. One of the four HB lines (HepG2) had an N-ras mutation at codon 61 position 2. The p53 point mutations in the three HCC cell lines from Japan resulted in the amino acid changes of cysteine for tyrosine in cell line HuH 7 at codon 220 (A:T-->G:C), alanine for glycine in cell line HLF at codon 244 (G:C-->C:G), and serine for arginine in cell line HLE at codon 249 (G:C-->C:G). In addition, the deletion of 18 base pairs from codon 264 position 3 to codon 270 position 1 has resulted in the deletion of Leu-Gly-Arg-Asn-Ser-Phe from the amino acids sequences 256-270 in the Japanese cell line HuH 4. The cell line PLC/PRF/5 that showed p53 mutation at codon 249 (G:C-->T:A) with substitution of serine for arginine was derived from a South African patient. Our results indicate that whereas the p53 gene is not mutated in the HB cell lines, the HCC cell lines frequently contain an abnormal p53 gene. In addition, p53 point mutations were not detected in the four Japanese HCC cell lines that were positive for genomic integration of HBV X-gene and surface antigen gene. The three Japanese HCC cell lines with p53 mutations did not contain HBV sequences, indicating that hepatocarcinogenesis associated with p53 mutation does not require the genomic integration of HBV sequences.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma may help to ensure that patients have a chance for long-term survival; however, currently available biomarkers lack sensitivity and specificity. Aim: To characterize the serum metabolome of hepatocellular carcinoma in order to develop a new metabolomics diagnostic model and identifying novel biomarkers for screening hepatocellular carcinoma based on the pattern recognition method. Methods: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy was used to characterize the serum metabolome of hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 30) and cirrhosis (n = 29) patients, followed by sequential feature selection combined with linear discriminant analysis to process the multivariate data. Results: The concentrations of most metabolites, including proline, were lower in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas the hydroxypurine levels were higher in these patients. As ordinary analysis models failed to discriminate hepatocellular carcinoma from cirrhosis, pattern recognition analysis was used to establish a pattern recognition model that included hydroxypurine and proline. The leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were 95.00% and 0.90 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.81-0.99] for the training set, respectively, and 78.95% and 0.84 (95%CI: 0.67-1.00) for the validation set, respectively. In contrast, for α-fetoprotein, the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 65.00% and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.52-0.86) for the training set, respectively, and 68.42% and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.41-0.94) for the validation set, respectively. The Z test revealed that the area under the curve of the linear discriminant analysis model was significantly higher than the area under the curve of α-fetoprotein (P < 0.05) in both the training and validation sets. Conclusion: Hydroxypurine and proline might be novel biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma, and this disease could be diagnosed by the metabolomics model based on pattern recognition.",

    "Abstract": "Characteristics of human hepatoma cell lines with the wild-type p53 were compared with those of human hepatoma cell lines with the mutant-type p53. The p21 protein located downstream of p53 was expressed in cell lines with the wild-type p53 but was not expressed in cell lines with the mutant-type p53. As to other tumor suppressor genes such as p16 and p27, there was no difference in their expression between both types of cell lines. In addition, no marked difference was observed in the activities of CDK2 and CDK4 between cell lines with the wild-type and the mutant-type p53. Phosphorylated Rb protein was detected in all cell lines except the HLE line, indicating that this cell line may have a deletion of and/or a mutation of the Rb gene. These results indicate that abnormalities of tumor suppressor genes other than p53, p16, p27, and Rb may be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. The population doubling time of the wild-type p53 cells was significantly longer than that of the mutant p53 cells. Neither type of cell line showed a specific chromosome distribution which would indicate karyotype instability. The cell lines expressing the wild-type p53 produced tumors at lower frequency than those with the mutant p53 gene. Although there was no significant difference in effects of TGF-beta 1, EGF, cholera toxin, and db-cAMP on cell growth between the two types of cells, all three cell lines with the wild-type p53 were resistant to cytotoxicity of TNF-alpha, while two of the three with the mutant p53 were very sensitive to its cytotoxic effects.",

Methods: We reviewed 245 patients with Child grade B liver function who underwent treatment with curative intent for HCC. Among these patients, 116 patients underwent curative treatment combined with splenectomy (the splenectomy group); the other 129 patients only underwent curative treatment (the non-splenectomy group). A one-to-one matching produced 95 paired patients, perioperative and oncological outcomes were compared, and liver function changes were reassessed 1 year later. Results: The perioperative liver failure rates were 7.4% and 6.3% (P = 1.000) and the 90-day mortality was 4.2% and 6.3% (P = 0.747) in the splenectomy group and non-splenectomy group, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were remarkably greater in the splenectomy group than in the non-splenectomy group (92.6% vs. 79.8%, 53.4% vs. 34.7%, and 19.9% vs. 11.0%, respectively; P = 0.004). In the univariate and multivariate analyses, splenectomy was identified as a protective factor for long-term survival. The proportion of patients whose liver function improved to Child A 1 year after surgery was also higher in the splenectomy group than in the non-splenectomy group (95.4% vs. 83.3%; P = 0.048). Conclusions: Compared with non-splenectomy, curative treatments combined with splenectomy for patients with HCC and Child B grade liver function showed no different perioperative outcomes but achieved significant survival benefit. Splenectomy is a beneficial factor for patients with HCC and Child B liver function; liver function improved significantly 1 year after splenectomy.",

We aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of the two novel established cirrhosis-associated models based on gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and platelets in hepatitis B-associated HCC. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 182 HCC patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen who received radical therapy at a single institution between 2002 and 2012. Laboratory data prior to operation were collected to calculate the GGT to platelets ratio (GPR) and the S-index. Predictive factors associated with overall survival and recurrence-free survival were assessed using log-rank test and multivariate Cox analysis. Additional analyses were performed after patients were stratified based on cirrhosis status, tumor size, therapy methods, and so forth, to investigate the prognostic significance in different subgroups. Results: During a median follow-up time of 45.0 months, a total of 88 (48.4%) patients died and 79 (43.4%) patients recurred. The cut-off points for GPR and S-index in predicting death were determined to be 0.76 and 0.56, respectively. Compared with patients with a lower GPR, those with GPR ≥0.76 had a higher probability of cirrhosis and a larger tumor (both P<0.05). GPR and S-index were both found to be significantly associated with survival by univariate log-rank test. Multivariate analysis identified tumor size ≥5 and high level of GPR, but not high Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage or S-index, as independent factors for predicting poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Conclusion: The GPR is an effective preoperative predictor for outcomes in hepatitis B-associated HCC.",

The relationship between baseline HFF and metabolic parameters and circulating levels of CK-18 at follow-up were assessed using a bivariate correlation. Results: At baseline, 38% had hepatic steatosis based on %HFF ≥5.5% with alterations in indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion. At follow-up, BMI increased in both groups and baseline %HFF correlated strongly with the follow-up %HFF (r = 0.81, P < 0.001). Over time, markers of insulin sensitivity and 2-h glucose improved significantly in the group without fatty liver, in contrast with the persistence of the insulin resistance and associated correlates in the fatty liver group. Baseline HFF correlated with 2-h glucose (r = 0.38, P = 0.001), whole-body insulin sensitivity (r = -0.405, P = 0.001), adiponectin (r = -0.44, P < 0.001), CK-18 levels, (r = 0.63, P < 0.001), and disposition index (r = -0.272, P = 0.021) at follow-up. In a multivariate analysis, we showed that baseline HFF is an independent predictor of 2-h glucose and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Conclusions: In obese youth, the phenotype of MRI-measured hepatic steatosis is persistent. Baseline HFF strongly modulates longitudinally 2-h blood glucose, biomarkers of insulin resistance, and hepatocellular apoptosis.",

Methods: Gene transfection was operated by Lipofectin on SF7721 cells. The difference of the cells before and after transfection was compared by MTT, growth curves and transwell test in vitro. In vivo, the cells before and after transfection were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice respectively to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Results: C-Met antisense oligonucleotide could inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma SF7721 cells (t=3.58, P<0.05). After transfection, the expression of c-Met protein decreased. Growth curves showed that the cells after transfection proliferated more slowly, about 50% of control cells (F=4.87, P<0.05), and their motility and invasiveness decreased, compared with those before transfected. In vivo experiment, tumors originated from c-Met antisense oligonucleotide treated cells and the antisense/ribozyme/U1SnRNA treated cells grew more slowly (about 54.5% of those from the control cells), and the latent prolonged. After 35 days, the average weight of tumors in the two group nude mice were lighter than that in the control group nude mice (F=5.17, P<0.05). Conclusion: Inhibition of c-Met expression by c-Met antisense oligonucleotide and the complex of antisense/ribozyme/U1SnRNA can inhibit the growth and metastasis of SF7721 hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with fever as the initial presentation are extremely rare. Our aim was to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with this disease. Patients and methods: The clinical features were analyzed in a retrospective study of 63 HCC patients with fever as the first manifestation and 300 HCC patients without fever as the control group. Results: HCC patients with fever had a higher neutrophil percentage, larger tumor size, worse tumor differentiation, advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, and more hilar lymph node metastasis than HCC patients without fever (all P<0.05). Compared with HCC patients without fever, patients presenting with fever had shorter overall survival (OS, median: 13 months, P<0.001) and time to recurrence (TTR, median: 7.5 months, P<0.001). In addition, HCC patients with fever also had shorter OS and TTR than those without fever in all clinical subgroups with aggressive features (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that neutrophil percentage >70%, fever grade ≥38.5°C, tumor size >5 cm, and hilar lymph node metastasis were independent factors for OS and TTR. A positive correlation was observed between body temperature and serum neutrophil percentage (r=0.527, P<0.001). Patients with a fever grade ≥38.5°C had more incomplete encapsulation and larger tumor size, while those with a neutrophil percentage >70% presented with more incomplete encapsulation, vascular invasion, and worse tumor differentiation. Patients with a fever grade ≥38.5°C combined with a neutrophil percentage >70% had worse OS and TTR than other groups. Conclusion: HCC patients presenting with fever have poorer prognosis than those without fever; however, their prognosis could be improved by timely surgical intervention. Patients with a neutrophil percentage >70% and a fever grade ≥38.5°C represent a rare HCC subgroup with an extremely dismal outcome and more aggressive clinical course.",

    "Abstract": "Point mutations in exons of the tumor suppressor p53 gene occur frequently in many human tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma and are extensively studied. However, intronic point mutations are rare and are totally unknown for hepatocellular carcinoma. By reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification of p53 RNA from hepatocellular carcinoma tissues of 45 Taiwanese patients, we found amplified complementary DNA fragments of abnormal size in 4 (9%) tumor samples. Sequence analysis of these complementary DNA products revealed aberrant retention of intron 7 in one sample, insertion of 49 base pairs of the 3' end of intron 6 in 2 samples, and deletion of exon 4 in the other sample. Direct sequencing of their genomic DNA revealed relevant point mutations at consensus sequence at either the 5' or 3' splice site of intron 7, 6, 6, and 3, respectively. The splicing mutations produced p53 mutants with truncation of COOH-terminus that are identical to those found in lung cancers. Three of the 4 patients with splicing mutations were younger and had huge tumors. The results suggest a possible role of these p53 mutants in the development of human cancers.",

    "Abstract": "The human inducible nitric oxide synthase (hiNOS) gene is regulated by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and has recently been shown to be a target of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling might regulate cytokine- or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced hiNOS expression through interaction with NF-kappaB. A cytokine mixture of TNFalpha + interleukin (IL)-1beta + IFNgamma induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in hiNOS promoter activity in HCT116 and DLD1 colon cells, but produced a 2-fold decrease in SW480 colon cancer cells. A similar differential activity was seen in liver cancer cells (HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B). Overexpression of beta-catenin produced a dose-dependent decrease in NF-kappaB reporter activity and decreased cytokine mixture-induced hiNOS promoter activity. Gel shift for TNFalpha-induced hiNOS NF-kappaB activation showed decreased p50 binding and decreased NF-kappaB reporter activity in the beta-catenin-mutant HAbeta18 cells. Conversely, enhanced p50 binding and increased NF-kappaB reporter activity were seen in HAbeta85 cells, which lack beta-catenin signaling. Coimmunoprecipitation confirmed that beta-catenin complexed with both p65 and p50 NF-kappaB proteins. NF-kappaB-dependent Traf1 protein expression also inversely correlated with the level of beta-catenin. Furthermore, SW480 cells stably transformed with wild-type adenomatous polyposis coli showed decreased beta-catenin protein and increased TNFalpha-induced p65 NF-kappaB binding as well as iNOS and Traf1 expression. Finally, beta-catenin inversely correlated with iNOS and Fas expression in vivo in hepatocellular carcinoma tumor samples. Our in vitro and in vivo data show that beta-catenin signaling inversely correlates with cytokine-induced hiNOS and other NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. These findings underscore the complex role of Wnt/beta-catenin, NF-kappaB, and iNOS signaling in the pathophysiology of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The underlying genetic factors for the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are largely unknown. TNFalpha is a well characterized inflammatory mediator and is implicated in the development of HCC. We investigated TNFalpha polymorphisms for association with HCC. Methods: The study population consisted of 227 HCC patients and 365 age and sex matched Korean controls. TNFalpha polymorphisms (G-238A, C-857T, and C-863A) were genotyped using pyrosequencing analysis. TNFalpha levels in patients with HCC were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association with HCC and haplotype was calculated using EH program. Results: Of three TNFalpha polymorphisms investigated in our study, C-863A did not correlate with HCC. However, both G-238A and C-857T were found to be significantly associated with HCC. TNFalpha -238A allele was more frequent in HCC patients than in control [P=0.012; odds ratio (OR), 1.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-3.13]. TNFalpha -857T was significantly associated with HCC patients (P=0.001; OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.21-2.19). Haplotype analysis revealed that the GTC haplotype (G-238A, C-857T, C-863A) was a risk marker for HCC (P=0.0021). Serum TNFalpha level was significantly increased in HCC patients with CT+TT genotype for TNFalpha -857 (P=0.018). Conclusion: Our data imply that TNFalpha G-238A and C-857T, not C-863A, polymorphisms may confer different susceptibilities to the development of HCC with TNFalpha -238A and -857T alleles playing as risk factors.",

This cell line carried two kinds of abnormal p53 transcripts; one lacked the exon 8 sequence, and the other had a single base substitution G to T which resulted in a new stop codon in exon 8. In the genomic DNA, this base substitution in exon 8 was present, indicating that both transcripts were transcribed from the mutated gene. No mutation was detected in its two flanking introns. In this cell line, the exon-deleted transcript seems to be generated by exon skipping due to an unknown mechanism other than splice site mutations.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The risk of significant morbidity and mortality often outweighs the benefit of surgical resection as palliative treatment for patients with high systemic disease burden, poor cardiopulmonary status, and previous spinal surgeries. Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approaches to decompressing metastatic epidural cord compression (MECC) can address these issues and thereby make palliation a feasible option for these patients. Case description: We present the cases of three consecutively collected patients with severe neurological compromise secondary to lumbar epidural metastases who underwent MIS decompression and achieved improved functional outcome and quality of life. The first patient is a 23-year-old female with metastatic Ewing's sarcoma who presented with 2 weeks of a right foot drop and radiculopathic pain. The next case is that of a 71-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who presented with significant radiculopathic L5-S1 pain and severe motor deficits in his lower extremities. The last case is that of a 73-year-old male with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma who presented with worsening left leg weakness, paresthesia, and dysethesia. Postoperatively, each patient experienced significant improvement and almost complete enduring return of function, strength, and resolution of pain. Conclusion: We demonstrate that MIS approaches to spinal decompression as palliative treatment for metastatic disease is a viable treatment in patients with a focal symptomatic lesion and comes with the benefits of decreased surgical morbidity inherent to the minimally invasive approach as well as excellent functional outcomes.",

Method: A total of 57 participants were divided into control group (healthy participants, n = 10) and hepatocellular carcinoma group (hepatocellular carcinoma patients, n = 37). The expression of microRNA-21 levels were first detected in these two groups. Cell transfection was performed on hepatoma cell lines, followed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and Transwell assay to reveal proliferation and invasion ability. Furthermore, the relation between microRNA-21 and smad family member 7 was revealed by luciferase reporter gene and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, a transplantation tumor model of breast cancer in mice was constructed. Results: The serum indicators including α-alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and albumin were differentially expressed between hepatocellular carcinoma group and control group. Compared to the control group, there was a high expression of microRNA-21 in hepatocellular carcinoma group. Low expression of microRNA-21 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HepG2.2.15 and Huh7-1.3 cells. Luciferase reporter gene and RNA innumoprecipitation assay showed that smad family member 7 was the target gene of microRNA-21. Moreover, mice model analysis showed that microRNA-21 might regulate the growth of the transplanted tumors in mice by targeting smad family member 7. Conclusion: The upregulated microRNA-21 might participate in the proliferation and migration in cells of hepatocellular carcinoma via suppression of smad family member 7. Furthermore, serum indicators such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and albumin might be used as serum diagnostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Ablative therapies (AT) are widely utilized as bridging treatment for liver transplantation (LT) candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are on the transplant waiting list to minimize dropout rate. We aimed to investigate whether AT could be considered a primary treatment modality for LT candidates with single, small HCC lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively investigated the outcomes of patients with AT for single HCC lesions as primary treatment or bridging to LT between 2010 and 2017, compared with surgical resection (SR) during the same time period as control. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed. Matched analysis, after propensity score matching (PSM), was performed to minimize the selection bias confounding effect on outcomes. RESULTS Of 162 patients identified, 92 received AT and 70 had SR. PSM identified 38 paired matches in each group. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) before matching showed comparable outcomes for each treatment after 1, 3, and 5 years. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression models adjusting the study confounders showed lesion size (>30 mm), not treatment received, was associated with worse DFS (hazard ratio, 2.21 [95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.28]). In the matched groups, OS and DFS were equivalent and consistent with the whole-cohort survival outcomes. Explant histopathology of patients having AT as a bridge to LT showed complete pathological response in 85.7% of patients. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the use of AT with curative intent for single ≤3-cm HCCs, particularly in LT candidates, with salvage transplantation kept as a backup in case of recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "Background: CheckMate 040 assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Understanding the safety profile of nivolumab is needed to support the management of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). This analysis assessed the safety of nivolumab monotherapy in the phase I/II, open-label CheckMate 040 study. Materials and methods: Select TRAEs (sTRAEs; TRAEs with potential immunologic etiology requiring more frequent monitoring) occurring between first dose and 30 days after last dose were analyzed in patients in the dose-escalation and -expansion phases. Time to onset (TTO), time to resolution (TTR), and recurrence of sTRAEs were assessed, and the outcome of treatment with immune-modulating medication (IMM) was evaluated. Results: The analysis included 262 patients. The most common sTRAE was skin (35.5%), followed by gastrointestinal (14.5%) and hepatic (14.1%) events; the majority were grade 1/2, with 10.7% of patients experiencing grade 3/4 events. One patient had grade 5 pneumonitis. Median (range) TTO ranged from 3.6 (0.1-59.9) weeks for skin sTRAEs to 47.6 (47.1-48.0) weeks for renal sTRAEs. Overall, 68% of sTRAEs resolved, with median (range) TTR ranging from 3.7 (0.1-123.3+) weeks for gastrointestinal sTRAEs to 28.4 (0.1-79.1) weeks for endocrine sTRAEs. Most gastrointestinal and all hepatic events resolved with treatment in accordance with established toxicity management algorithms. In 57 patients (40%), sTRAEs were managed with IMM. Reoccurrence of sTRAEs was uncommon following rechallenge with nivolumab. Conclusion: Nivolumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile in this analysis of patients with advanced HCC. A majority of sTRAEs resolved with treatment. Implications for practice: Nivolumab is a viable treatment option for patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma as it has demonstrated durable tumor responses and promising survival. Nivolumab has a manageable safety profile. The most common select treatment-related adverse events (sTRAEs) in this analysis were skin related (35%). Gastrointestinal and hepatic sTRAEs were observed in approximately 14% of patients. The majority of sTRAEs resolved (68%). Safety events are easier to manage if addressed early. Patient education on signs and symptoms to watch out for and the importance of early reporting and consultation should be emphasized.",

In well-differentiated HCCs, the immunoreactivity for these antigens was well preserved, and the staining intensity was stronger compared to the surrounding liver tissues. However, among 41 moderately-differentiated and 9 poorly-differentiated HCCs of the resected cases, hMLH1- and hMSH2-positive cells were significantly reduced in 19 (38%) and 9 (18%) cases, respectively. In 9 resected tumors, the expression of both of these antigens was reduced. Moreover, in 41 tumors of differing histological grades, 10 and 5 tumors for hMLH1 and hMSH2, respectively, contained a less-differentiated area with a reduced number of immunoreactive cells. The samples from non-cancerous biopsied liver and fetal autopsy tissue were well immunostained for both hMLH1 and hMSH2. We confirmed in this series that the hMLH1 and hMSH2 defect did commonly occur in high-grade HCCs, and that it might play a role in tumor progression.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Chemoresistance is a major problem during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment; thus, finding novel chemosensitizers and elucidating the underlying mechanisms that contribute to chemoresistance in HCC is critical. Methods: Cell viability assays were used to detect the combined effects of ulinastatin (UTI) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on the proliferation of HCC cells. RT-qPCR, western blot, sphere formation, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity assays were used to examine UTI-mediated effects on HCC cell stemness and related mechanisms. Results: We constructed 5-FU-resistant HCC cell lines and found that their stemness was higher than parental cells, as evidenced by increased sphere-formation ability, ALDH1 activity, and expression of stemness regulatory genes. While UTI had no effect on the viability of HCC cells, it significantly reduced the stemness of 5-FU-resistant HCC cells, which was determined by decreased sphere-formation capacity, ALDH1 activity, and expression of stemness-related genes. Furthermore, UTI attenuated 5-FU resistance in 5-FU-resistant HCC cells and enhanced the 5-FU sensitivity of parental cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that UTI suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which was responsible for the activity of UTI on the stemness of HCC cells. Conclusions: UTI enhanced the 5-FU sensitivity of HCC cells by attenuating their stemness via inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is an important mechanism for maintaining fidelity of genomic DNA. Abnormalities in one or more MMR genes are implicated in the development of many cancers. We investigated the role of expression of MMR genes (hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2, GTBP/hMSH6, hMSH2) in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Methods: We evaluated the expression level of MMR genes in 33 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases using the multiplex reverse transcription (RT) PCR assays, as well as in 16 cases of normal adjacent hepatic tissues. beta-actin gene was used as an internal control and calibrator for quantification of gene expression. Results: Out of the 33 studied cases, 25 were HCV positive and 30 (90.9%) showed reduced expression in one or more of the studied MMR genes. Reduced expression was found in hMSH2 (71.9%), hMLH1 (53.3%), GTBP (51.1%), hPMS2 (33.3%) and hPMS1 (6%). A significant correlation was found between reduced expression of hPMS2 (P = 0.0069) and GTBP (P = 0.0034), hPMS2 and non-cirrhosis (P = 0.0197), hMLH1 and high grade. On the other hand, 57.1%, 50%, 20%, 18.8%, and 6% of the normal tissues distant to tumors showed reduced expression of hMSH2, hMLH1, GTBP, hPMS2, and hPMS1 respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between the expression level of hMSH2 (P = 0.008), hMLH1 (P = 0.001) and GTBP (P = 0.032) and HCC, between hPMS2, GTBP and HCV-associated HCC (P<0.001, 0.002). Conclusion: Reduced expression of MMR genes seems to play an important role in HCV-associated HCC. hPMS2 is likely involved at an early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis since it was detected in normal adjacent tissues. Reduced expression of hPMS2 provides a growth advantage and stimulates proliferation which encourages malignant transformation in non-cirrhotic HCV-infected patients via acquisition of more genetic damages.",

    "Abstract": "Context: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global public health problem and a major etiology of chronic liver disease, which may develop into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Genotypes of HCV indicate the route of acquisition, the clinical outcome, response to treatment, prognosis and control strategies. Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate the overall prevalence and trend of HCV genotypes or subtypes in Iran. Data sources: A literature review was done for papers reporting HCV genotypes in Iranian patients in PubMed, Magiran, IranMedex, Scientific Information Databank, and Google scholar databases. Study selection: Data were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction: Data were abstracted by two independent authors. Data were analyzed based on random-effects model using the Meta R. Pooled statistical software. Prevalence of HCV genotypes in cities and provinces of Iran with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results: Fifty-three articles published between 1999 and 31 June 2014 including 22952 HCV infected individuals were included in the meta-analysis. Subtype 1a was predominant with a rate of 39% (95% CI: 34-44%); followed by subtype 3a, 32% (95% CI: 26-39%); subtype 1b, 13% (95% CI: 10-15%); genotype 4, 5.18% (95% CI: 3.27-7.5%); and genotype 2, 3.6% (95% CI: 1.6-8.3%). Untypeable HCV had a rate of 0.11% (95% CI: 0.07-0.16%). Conclusions: The most frequent subtypes of HCV in Iran were 1a, 3a and 1b, respectively. This frequency differed in various provinces of Iran and fluctuated with time. It is important to determine the distribution of HCV genotypes in different geographical areas and its trend with time for epidemiological and patients' management purposes.",

    "Abstract": "p53 is the most frequently mutated tumour-suppressor gene in human cancers. Mutant p53 is thought to contribute to carcinogenesis by the acquisition of gain-of-function properties or through the exertion of dominant-negative (DN) effects over the remaining wild-type protein. However, the context in which the DN effects are observed is not well understood. We have therefore generated 'knock-in' mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to investigate the effects of expressing a commonly found hot-spot p53 mutant, R246S -- the mouse equivalent of human R249S, which is associated with hepatocellular carcinomas. We demonstrate here that R246S mutant p53 exhibits DN effects with respect to target gene expression, cell survival and cell cycle arrest both in cells that are in the undifferentiated state and upon differentiation. The knock-in cells contain higher levels of p53 that localizes to the nucleus even in the absence of genotoxic stress and yet remains non-functional, reminiscent of mutant p53 found in human tumours. In a model based on carbon-tetrachloride-induced liver injury, these cells were consistently highly tumorigenic in vivo, similar to p53(-/-) cells and in contrast to both p53(+/+) and p53(+/-) ES cells. These data therefore indicate that the DN effects of mutant p53 are evident in the stem-cell context, in which its expression is relatively high compared with terminally differentiated cells.",

    "Abstract": "We have generated a mouse model for hepatocellular carcinoma using somatic delivery of oncogene-bearing avian retroviral vectors to the liver cells of mice expressing the viral receptor TVA under the control of the albumin gene promoter (Alb-TVA mice). Viruses encoding mouse polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT) induced tumors, which can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging, in 65% of TVA-positive animals. While these tumors can exceed 10 mm in diameter, they do not invade locally or metastasize to the lungs. Delivery of PyMT-expressing viruses to Alb-TVA mice lacking an intact p53 gene does not increase tumor incidence. However, the resulting tumors are poorly differentiated, invasive, and metastatic to the lungs. Gene expression microarrays identified over 100 genes that are differentially expressed between tumors found in p53 wild-type and p53 null mice. Some of these genes, such as cathepsin E and Igf2, have been previously implicated in tumor cell migration and invasion. Tumors induced in p53 null, TVA transgenic mice by PyMT mutants with changes in specific tyrosine residues fail to form metastases, indicating that metastasis is dependent on both the oncogene and the absence of p53.",

We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the correlation between OCT4 and the clinicopathological characteristics and the prognostic value in HCC. Methods: An electronic search for relevant articles was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE database, Chinese CNKI, and Chinese WanFang database. Correlations between OCT4 expression and clinicopathological features and survival outcomes were analyzed. Pooled odds ratios and hazard ratios with 95% CIs were calculated using STATA 14.2 software. Results: A total of 10 trials with 985 patients were included. Positive OCT4 expression was correlated with tumor size, tumor numbers, differentiation, and TNM stage. OCT4 expression was not correlated with gender, age, hepatitis B surface antigen, alfa-fetoprotein, liver cirrhosis, vascular invasion, or tumor encapsulation. OCT4 expression was associated with poor 3- and 5-year overall survival, and disease-free survival rate. Conclusion: OCT4 expression was associated with tumor size, tumor numbers, differentiation, and TNM stage in HCC. OCT4 may be a useful prognostic biomarker for HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Predictive biomarkers for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have great benefit in the selection of treatment options, including liver transplantation (LT), for HCC. The purpose of this study was to identify specific microRNAs (miRs) in exosomes from the serum of patients with recurrent HCC and to validate these molecules as novel biomarkers for HCC recurrence. Methods: We employed microarray-based expression profiling of miRs derived from exosomes in the serum of HCC patients to identify a biomarker that distinguishes between patients with and without HCC recurrence after LT. This was followed by the validation in a separate cohort of 59 HCC patients who underwent living related LT. The functions and potential gene targets of the recurrence-specific miRs were analysed using a database, clinical samples and HCC cell lines. Results: We found that miR-718 showed significantly different expression in the serum exosomes of HCC cases with recurrence after LT compared with those without recurrence. Decreased expression of miR-718 was associated with HCC tumour aggressiveness in the validated cohort series. We identified HOXB8 as a potential target gene of miR-718, and its upregulation was associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion: Circulating miRs in serum exosomes have potential as novel biomarkers for predicting HCC recurrence.",

KL mRNA was shown to be expressed in a variety of epithelial tissues and cell lines. The expression of c-kit mRNA was then examined in hepatocellular and colon carcinoma cell lines. While hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines did not express c-kit mRNA as far as we could ascertain, 2 of 5 colon carcinoma cell lines showed the expression of both c-kit and KL mRNAs. Furthermore, the expression of c-kit in these cells was demonstrated at the protein level by flow cytometry.

    "Abstract": "NCTD is a demethylated form of cantharidin with antitumor properties, which is now in use as a routine anticancer drug against hepatoma. However, there is limited information on the effect of NCTD on human cancer cells. In the present study, NCTD inhibited proliferation, caused mitotic arrest, then progressed to apoptosis within 96 hr in 3 human hepatoma cell lines: HepG2, Hep3B and Huh-7. NCTD treatment (5 microg/ml) enhanced the expression of Cdc25C and p21(Cip1/Waf1), increasing the phosphorylation of these 2 proteins. In addition, NCTD treatment induced an earlier increase in cyclin B1-associated histone H1 kinase activity within 48 hr, but an approximately 70% reduction of both protein level and kinase activity of cyclin B1 was observed at 72 hr. Treatment with NCTD significantly decreased the expression of p53 protein but did not affect the expression of Cdk1 and p27(Kip1). Moreover, NCTD treatment also increased the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) but did not affect the expression of Bax or Bad. Bcl-2 phosphorylation appears to inhibit its binding to Bax since less Bax was detected in immunocomplex with Bcl-2 in NCTD-treated HepG2 cells. In addition, NCTD treatment caused activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, preceding DNA fragmentation and morphologic features of apoptosis. Pretreatment with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk markedly inhibited NCTD-induced caspase-3 activity and cell death. These results suggest that phosphorylation of p21(Cip1/Waf1) and Cdc25C and biphasic regulation of cyclin B1-associated kinase activity may contribute to NCTD-induced M-phase cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, the increase of p21(Cip1/Waf1), phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 may be the molecular mechanism through which NCTD induces apoptosis.",

We observed the overexpression of p53 protein in 69% of HCC, despite the prevalence of the wild-type p53 gene. However, the overexpressed p53 protein was nonfunctional as suggested by its inability to modulate the expressions of several p53 effector proteins (p21 and Bcl-2 family proteins). In addition, we observed significant underexpression of two proapoptotic proteins, Bax and Bcl-X(S), in 81% (P = 0.02) and 64% (P = 0.03) of HCC, respectively. Consequently, the ratios of proapoptotic to antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins were reduced in 88% of the HCC tumor tissues when compared to normal tissues, such that the rheostat between BCL-2 family proteins is strongly skewed toward enhanced cell survival in the tumor cells.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; EC 4.1.1.17) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines. ODC protein has a characteristic amino acid sequence, the PEST sequence, which is related to the enzyme's rapid degradation. ODC cDNA prepared from human hepatoma tissues has been reported to show nonsense or missense mutations. Methods: We examined somatic mutations of ODC cDNA by RT-PCR-SSCP analysis and mRNA expressions by RT-PCR in 50 colorectal cancer tissues to investigate the involvement of ODC gene alterations in colorectal cancers. Results: Increased expression of the ODC gene was observed in 36 cases (86%) out of the 42 examined by RT-PCR. In one case, a missense mutation was found in the cancer tissue but not in normal mucosa. The missense mutation from Asp to Asn at codon 424, in the PEST region, possibly stabilizes the ODC protein. In colorectal cancer, replication error and a germline mutation in hMSH2 gene were observed. Conclusions: The missense mutation at codon 424 is speculated to be a cause of stabilization and a passenger mutation owing to the mutator phenotype. Since only one of 50 colorectal cancers exhibited a missense mutation of the ODC gene, mutations in ODC gene are not frequent in colorectal cancer. The increased expression of the ODC gene was noted in 86% of colorectal cancer tissues by RT-PCR, however, it was not due to point mutations in ODC coding exons.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The prognostic value of tissue and serum osteopontin (OPN) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain controversial. The aim of present meta-analysis was to evaluate the prognostic value of OPN in patients with HCC. Methods: Eligible studies were systematically searched by PubMed, EMBASE, and Google scholar. A meta-analysis of 12 studies included 2117 cases was performed to estimate the association between OPN level and overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) in HCC patients. Subgroup analyses were also performed in the meta-analysis. Results: The pooled data of studies showed that high OPN level was significantly associated with poor OS (hazard ratios [HR] 1.84; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.54-2.20; P = .000) and DFS (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.40-1.98; P = .000) in HCC. Furthermore, in subgroup analysis, high tissue based OPN by immunohistochemistry detection and serum-based OPN by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection were both significantly associated with OS (tissue: HR 1.88; 95% CI 1.53-2.31; P < .0001; serum: HR 2.38; 95% CI 1.58-3.59; P < .0001). Simultaneously, we also found that OPN expression was positively associated with stage (odds ratios [OR] 5.68; 95% CI 3.443-7.758), tumor size (Size≤5 cm vs >5 cm; OR 2.001; 95% CI1.036-3.867).

We aimed to establish nomograms for predicting the survival of solitary HCC patients after hepatectomy. Methods: A total of 538 solitary HCC patients were randomly classified into training and validation sets. A Cox model was used to identify predictors of overall survival (OS) in the training set. A nomogram was generated based on these predictors and was validated using the validation set. Results: Tumor size, microvascular invasion, and major vascular invasion were significantly associated with OS in the training set. Nomograms were developed based on these predictors in the multivariate analysis. The C-index was 0.75 for the OS nomogram and 0.72 for the recurrence-free survival nomogram. Compared to the index of conventional staging systems for predicting survival (0.71 for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, 0.66 for the seventh American Joint Committee on Cancer, 0.68 for Cancer of the Liver Italian Program, and 0.70 for Hong Kong Liver Cancer), the index of the OS nomogram was significantly higher. Moreover, the calibration curve fitted well between the predicted and observed survival rate. Similarly, in the validation set, the nomogram discrimination was superior to those of the four staging systems (p<0.001). Conclusions: The nomograms demonstrated good discrimination performance in predicting 3- and 5-year survival rates for solitary HCCs after hepatectomy.",

    "Abstract": "pp120, a plasma membrane glycoprotein, is phosphorylated on Tyr488 by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. This requires basal phosphorylation on Ser503 by cAMP-dependent serine kinase. Phe513, the other tyrosine residue in the intracellular domain, does not undergo insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. Phe488 mutation abolished basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation, whereas, Phe513 plus Phe488 mutation markedly decreased the effect of insulin on pp120 phosphorylation without altering basal phosphorylation in intact cells. To investigate whether basal phosphorylation of pp120 is regulated by a phosphatase activity that requires Tyr513, in vitro phosphorylation assays using partially purified glycoproteins from stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells were performed in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. Wild-type pp120 was promptly dephosphorylated, whereas, Y513F pp120 was not. Decreasing pp120 expression by antisense cDNA transfection proportionally decreased phosphatase activity in H4-II-E hepatoma cells measured by the p-nitrophenyl phosphate assay. This suggests that pp120 is associated with phosphatase activity that requires an intact Tyr513 residue.",

    "Abstract": "ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) is an efflux transporter that limits the cellular uptake levels of various drugs in intestine, brain, and other tissues. The expression of human ABCB1 has recently been reported to be under the control of nuclear receptor NR1I subfamily members, pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3). Here, we have investigated the involvement of another NR1I member, vitamin D receptor (VDR, NR1I1), in ABCB1 expression. In the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line LS174T, which abundantly expresses VDR, both 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD3) and lithocholic acid (LCA) increased ABCB1 mRNA levels. Reporter gene assays in LS174T cells with constructs containing various lengths of the ABCB1 regulatory region revealed that the region containing multiple nuclear receptor binding motifs located at -7.8 kilobases [termed nuclear receptor-responsive module (NURREM)], to which PXR and CAR also bind, is essential for the VDR-mediated ABCB1 transactivation. Further reporter assays with constructs containing truncated NURREM and gel shift assays suggested simultaneous binding of multiple VDR/retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimers to NURREM. Furthermore, knockdown of VDR expression in LS174T cells blocked the LCA- and the 1,25-VD3-induced transcription of ABCB1 reporter genes. In human hepatoma HepG2 cells, in contrast with LS174T cells, 1,25-VD3 activated the ABCB1 transcription only in the presence of ectopically expressed VDR. These results suggest that the NR1I subfamily members regulate the ABCB1 expression sharing the binding sites within NURREM and that the physiologically produced LCA and 1,25-VD3 may modulate the ABCB1 expression in human intestines, possibly associated with interindividual variations of ABCB1 expression.",

    "Abstract": "Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a tumor susceptibility gene for both hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. We have previously characterized GNMT genomic structure and mapped its chromosomal localization to 6p12. For this study we identified a GNMT transcriptional start site at the 14th position upstream of the ATG codon. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay results indicate binding of the nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) transcription factor to the CCAAT box (-71/-67) of the GNMT gene. Mutation assay results suggest that the nucleotide sequence in the -56/-47 region is a binding site for a putative transcriptional factor. The TATA-less core promoter (-133/+14) contains three major elements: an Sp1 site, CCAAT box, and a novel box within the CTGTCGGCTG sequence. One functional xenobiotic response element (XRE) located at the -104/-82 region is inducable by benzo[a]pyrene treatment. We believe our results have value for the study of GNMT transcriptional regulation.",

High-throughput sequencing technologies led to the identification of several molecular HCC subclasses that can be broadly grouped into 2 major subgroups, each characterized by specific morphological and phenotypical features. It is likely that this increasing knowledge and a more appropriate characterization of HCC at the pathological level will impact HCC patient management.",

    "Abstract": "Autophagy, an evolutionary conserved multifaceted lysosome-mediated bulk degradation system, plays a vital role in liver pathologies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Post-translational modifications (PTMs) and genetic variations in autophagy components have emerged as significant determinants of autophagy related proteins. Identification of a comprehensive spectrum of genetic variations and PTMs of autophagy related proteins and their impact at molecular level will greatly expand our understanding of autophagy based regulation. In this study, we attempted to identify high risk missense mutations that are highly damaging to the structure as well as function of autophagy related proteins including LC3A, LC3B, BECN1 and SCD1. Number of putative structural and functional residues, including several sites that undergo PTMs were also identified. In total, 16 high-risk SNPs in LC3A, 18 in LC3B, 40 in BECN1 and 43 in SCD1 were prioritized. Out of these, 2 in LC3A (K49A, K51A), 1 in LC3B (S92C), 6 in BECN1 (S113R, R292C, R292H, Y338C, S346Y, Y352H) and 6 in SCD1 (Y41C, Y55D, R131W, R135Q, R135W, Y151C) coincide with potential PTM sites. Our integrated analysis found LC3B Y113C, BECN1 I403T, SCD1 R126S and SCD1 Y218C as highly deleterious HCC-associated mutations. This study is the first extensive in silico mutational analysis of the LC3A, LC3B, BECN1 and SCD1 proteins. We hope that the observed results will be a valuable resource for in-depth mechanistic insight into future investigations of pathological missense SNPs using an integrated computational platform.",

    "Abstract": "Internal abdominal hernias are rarely reported in the literature and have a very low rate of preoperative diagnosis. It is even rarer that they present with jaundice. A 59-year-old Caucasian female presented with a short history of jaundice, dark urine, epigastric pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Her liver biochemistry profile revealed a mixed cholestatic/hepatocellular pattern with significantly elevated bilirubin. She urgently underwent abdominal imaging which provided a preoperative diagnosis of internal herniation of the cecum within the lesser sac through the foramen of Winslow. The dilated bowel was compressing the common bile duct explaining the jaundice. This was repaired intraoperatively by anchoring the mobile cecum. In this case, we highlight the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for internal herniation on abdominal imaging with clinical evidence of intestinal obstruction. A foramen of Winslow hernia should be further suspected in the presence of jaundice.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to evaluate the expression of microRNA-324-3p (miR-324-3p) in HBV-related HCC and explore the clinical significance of serum miR-324-3p and other available biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of HBV-related HCC. Methods: Expression of miR-324-3p in HBV infection-related cells and patients was estimated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of serum miR-324-3p, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and protein induced by vitamin K absence/antagonist II (PIVKA-II) in the differentiation of HBV-related HCC from healthy controls and chronic hepatitis B patients (CHB). The relationship between serum miR-324-3p and patients' clinical features was assessed using the chi-square test, and the value of miR-324-3p to predict overall survival prognosis was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression assay in patients with HBV-related HCC. Results: HBV-related HCC cells had significantly increased miR-324-3p compared with normal and HBV-unrelated HCC cells, and serum miR-324-3p in HCC patients with HBV infection was also higher than that in healthy controls and CHB. Serum miR-324-3p had relatively high diagnostic accuracy for the screening of HCC cases with HBV infection, and the combination of miR-324-3p, AFP, and PIVKA-II showed improved diagnostic performance. Additionally, high-serum miR-324-2p in HBV-related HCC patients was associated with cirrhosis, tumor size, clinical stage, and poor overall survival prognosis. Conclusions: High-serum miR-324-3p may be involved in the progression of HBV-related hepatitis to HCC and may serve as a candidate biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of HBV-related HCC.",

Here, we developed CNApp, a web-based tool that allows a comprehensive exploration of CNAs by using purity-corrected segmented data from multiple genomic platforms. CNApp generates genome-wide profiles, computes CNA scores for broad, focal and global CNA burdens, and uses machine learning-based predictions to classify samples. We applied CNApp to the TCGA pan-cancer dataset of 10,635 genomes showing that CNAs classify cancer types according to their tissue-of-origin, and that each cancer type shows specific ranges of broad and focal CNA scores. Moreover, CNApp reproduces recurrent CNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma and predicts colon cancer molecular subtypes and microsatellite instability based on broad CNA scores and discrete genomic imbalances. In summary, CNApp facilitates CNA-driven research by providing a unique framework to identify relevant clinical implications. CNApp is hosted at https://tools.idibaps.org/CNApp/.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: Hepatic innervation in liver diseases is not fully understood. We here evaluated S100B expression as a marker of hepatic nerves in patients with various chronic liver diseases, topographically and semi-quantitatively. Methods: Liver specimens were obtained from 70 subjects (three controls, and 32 chronic hepatitis B, 14 chronic hepatitis C, 14 liver cirrhosis, and seven hepatocellular carcinoma patients). The hepatic nerve density was calculated based on immunohistochemical staining of S100B protein in the portal tracts and hepatic lobules. S100B mRNA levels were semi-quantitatively assessed as the S100B/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA ratio. Results: The densities of the hepatic nerves in portal tracts of chronic liver diseases were not significantly different from those of normal controls but the hepatic nerve densities in lobular areas of liver cirrhosis were significantly decreased (p = 0.025). Compared to the control, the S100B/GAPDH mRNA ratio was significantly decreased in chronic liver diseases (p = 0.006) and most decreased in chronic hepatitis C patients (p = 0.023). In chronic liver diseases, The S100B/GAPDH mRNA ratio tended to decrease as the fibrosis score > 0 (p = 0.453) but the overall correlation between the S100B/GAPDH mRNA ratio and fibrosis score was not statistically significant (r = 0.061, p = 0.657). Conclusions: Hepatic innervation is decreased in cirrhotic regenerating nodules compared to the control group and seems to decrease in early stages of fibrosis progression. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between changes of hepatic innervation and chronic liver disease progression.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Prophylaxis for hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence is essential after liver transplantation (LT) in HBV-associated recipients. We conducted real-world analysis of HBV prophylaxis after LT in the Korean population. Methods: Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) database and additionally collected data (n = 326) were analyzed with special reference to types of HBV prophylaxis. Results: The study cohort comprised 267 cases of living-donor LT and 59 cases of deceased-donor LT. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was diagnosed in 232 (71.2%) of these subjects. Antiviral agents were used in 255 patients (78.2%) prior to LT. HBV DNA was undetectable in 69 cases (21.2%) and detectable over wide concentrations in the other 257 patients (78.8%) prior to LT. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the store blood samples detected HBV DNA in all patients, with 159 patients (48.9%) showing concentrations > 100 IU/mL. Post-transplant HBV regimens during the first year included combination therapy in 196 (60.1%), hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) monotherapy in 121 (37.1%), and antiviral monotherapy in 9 (2.8%). In the second post-transplant year, these regimens had changed to combination therapy in 187 (57.4%), HBIG monotherapy in 112 (34.4%), and antiviral monotherapy in 27 (8.3%). Trough antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen titers > 500 IU/mL and >1,000 IU/mL were observed in 61.7% and 25.2%, respectively. The mean simulative half-life of HBIG was 21.6 ± 4.3 days with a median 17.7 days. Up to 2-year follow-up period, HCC recurrence and HBV recurrence developed in 18 (5.5%) and 6 (1.8%), respectively. HCC recurrence developed in 3 of 6 patients with HBV recurrence. Conclusion: Combination therapy is the mainstay of HBV prophylaxis protocols in a majority of Korean LT centers, but HBIG was often administered excessively. Individualized optimization of HBIG treatments using SHL is necessary to adjust the HBIG infusion interval.",

    "Abstract": "The Mus81 gene encodes a critical endonuclease involved in DNA repair and tumor suppression. Our previous study has shown reduced expression of Mus81 in hepatocellular carcinoma and its association with the metastatic potential and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of Mus81 in colorectal carcinoma is currently unknown. We therefore carried out the present study to explore the correlation between Mus81 expression and the progression of colorectal carcinoma. Mus81 expression in 92 cases of colorectal carcinoma and matched normal tissues was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that Mus81 expression in colorectal carcinoma tissues was significantly reduced compared with the corresponding normal tissues (P < 0.001) and the downregulation of Mus81 (decreased by more than 50%) was found in 60.9% (56/92) of colorectal carcinoma. Moreover, Mus81 downregulation correlated significantly to hepatic metastasis (P = 0.019) and a high TNM stage (P = 0.025) of colorectal carcinoma. In addition, the decrease of Mus81 was also detected in 10 cases of hepatic metastasis tissues compared with the corresponding primary colorectal carcinoma tissues (P = 0.016). More importantly, colorectal carcinoma patients with apparent Mus81 downregulation have shown significantly poorer overall survival than those with little Mus81 downregulation (P = 0.0374). Also, multivariable Cox regression analysis identified Mus81 downregulation as an independent prognostic factor for colorectal carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.678; P = 0.040). In conclusion, the reduced expression of Mus81 is closely related to hepatic metastasis and poor prognosis of colorectal carcinoma, indicating Mus81 as a novel prognostic marker for colorectal carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "Viral hepatitis-induced cirrhosis can progress to decompensated cirrhosis. Clinical decompensation represents a milestone event for the patient with cirrhosis, yet there remains uncertainty regarding precisely how to define this important phenomenon. With the development of broader treatment options for cirrhotic hepatitis patients, efficient identification of liver status before evolving to decompensated cirrhosis could be life-saving, but research on the topic has been limited by inconsistencies across studies, populations, and case-confirmation methods. We sought to determine whether diagnosis/procedure codes drawn from electronic health records (EHRs) could be used to identify patients with decompensated cirrhosis. In our first step, chart review was used to determine liver status (compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, non-cirrhotic) in patients from the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study. Next, a hybrid approach between Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression and Classification Regression Trees models was used to optimize EHR-based identification of decompensated cirrhosis, based on 41 diagnosis and procedure codes. These models were validated using tenfold cross-validation; method accuracy was evaluated by positive predictive values (PPVs) and area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Among 296 patients (23 with hepatitis B, 268 with hepatitis C, and 5 co-infected) with a 2:1 ratio of biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis to noncirrhosis, chart review identified 127 cases of decompensated cirrhosis (Kappa=0.88). The algorithm of five liver-related conditions-liver transplant, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal varices complications/procedures, ascites, and cirrhosis-yielded a PPV of 85% and an AUROC of 92%. A hierarchical subset of three conditions (hepatocellular carcinoma, ascites, and esophageal varices) demonstrated a PPV of 81% and an AUROC of 86%. Given the excellent predictive ability of our model, this EHR-based automated algorithm may be used to successfully identify patients with decompensated cirrhosis. This algorithm may contribute to timely identification and treatment of viral hepatitis patients who have progressed to decompensated cirrhosis.",

    "Abstract": "To determine whether a relationship exists between expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and clinicopathological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EGFR was examined in 25 patients surgically treated for HCC using [125I]1-labeled EGF binding assay. Six cases were classified as stage I, 12 as stage II, 4 as stage III, and 3 as stage IV. Partial hepatectomy was performed in 11 cases, segmentectomy in 6, and lobectomy in 8. The level of EGFR in HCC was 8.9 (14.6) fmol/mg protein in HCC and 11.4 (9.2) fmol/mg protein in the adjacent noncancerous diseased liver tissues, and EGFR level in HCC was significantly lower than that of noncancerous liver tissues. HCC stage I + II had significantly lower levels of EGFR compared with stage III + IV (p < 0.05). Our study showed no obvious correlation between EGFR levels and other pathologic characteristics, such as tumor diameter, Edmondson's grade, extracapsular invasion, and vascular invasion. There was no significant difference in EGFR level between DNA diploid and aneuploid tumors. These results suggest that EGFR is not a relevant oncogenic factor for HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In a previous study, we reported a critical role of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) in the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and documented it to be a prognostic biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target for HCC. However, the role of EGFL8, the only known paralog of EGFL7, in human malignancies is currently unclear. Patients and methods: EGFL8 expression in 101 cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the clinicopathological features of the CRC patients were correlated with the EGFL8 down-regulation scores. In addition, the survival curve and Cox regression model were also employed to assess the prognostic value of EGFL8 down-regulation. Results: EGFL8 was significantly decreased in CRC tissues (p<0.0001) and the down-regulation of EGFL8 was evidenced in 74.3% (75/101) of the CRC patients. EGFL8 down-regulation correlated significantly to distant metastasis (p=0.038) and high TNM stage (p=0.012) of CRC. The CRC patients with high EGFL8 down-regulation showed either poorer disease-free survival (p=0.0167) or poorer overall survival (p=0.0310) than those with low EGFL8 down-regulation. Multivariable analysis identified EGFL8 down-regulation as an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients (hazard ratio, 12.974; p=0.037). Conclusion: The reduced expression of EGFL8 is closely related to metastastic potential and poor prognosis of CRC, suggesting the down-regulation of EGFL8 as a novel prognostic biomarker for CRC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) monthly in pregnant women and to explore the effect of parity. Design: Prospective cohort study from gestational week (GW) 26, at childbirth and postpartum. Setting: An antenatal care clinic in southeast Sweden. Sample: 390 pregnant women. Methods: Cortisol was measured using radioimmunoassay in methanol extracts of ground hair samples. Main outcome measures: Hair cortisol concentrations. Results: Both primi- and multiparae exhibited an increase in HCC throughout pregnancy. Primiparae had significantly higher HCC in the latter part of the last trimester compared with multiparae (1 month P = 0.003, 2 months P = 0.038). The use of psychotropic medication in the first trimester correlated to HCC postpartum (P < 0.001). HCC in GW 14-17 was associated with HCC in GW 18-21 (primiparae and multiparae, P < 0.001), GW 22-25 (primiparae P = 0.036, multiparae P = 0.033), and 2 months postpartum (primiparae P = 0.049). HCC in GW 18-21 was associated with GW 22-25 in both primiparae (P < 0.001) and multiparae (P < 0.001) as well as 2 months prior to childbirth among primiparae (<0.037). In general, all estimates of HCC in pregnancy and postpartum showed a significant association between HCC for a specific month and the HCC in the previous month (all P < 0.001), except for the association of HCC among primiparae in GW 22-25 and 3 months prior to childbirth. Conclusions: Increased cortisol concentrations in hair were observed during pregnancy, which decreased 3 months prior to childbirth in multiparae. The results indicate a quicker suppression of the hypothalamic CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) production by placenta CRH in multiparous women. Tweetable abstract: Multiparae have a quicker suppression of hypothalamic CRH production by placenta CRH during pregnancy compared to primiparae.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objectives: Patients undergoing synchronous open splenectomy and hepatectomy (OSH) for concurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hypersplenism usually have major surgical trauma caused by the long abdominal incision. Surgical procedures that contribute to rapid recovery with the least possible impairment are desired by both surgeons and patients. The objective of this study was to explore outcomes in patients treated with simultaneous laparoscopic or open splenectomy and hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with hypersplenism. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the treatment outcomes in 23 patients with cirrhosis, HCC, and hypersplenism, who underwent simultaneous laparoscopic splenectomy and hepatectomy (LSH; n = 12) or open splenectomy and hepatectomy (OSH; n = 11) from January 2012 through December 2015. Their perioperative variables were compared. Results: LSH was successful in all patients. There were nonsignificant similarities between the 2 groups in duration of operation, estimated blood loss, and volume of blood transfused (P > .05 each). Compared with OSH, LSH had a significantly shorter postoperative visual analog scale pain score (P < .001); shorter time to first oral intake (P < .001), passage of flatus (P < .05) and off-bed activity (P < .001); shorter postoperative duration of hospitalization (P < .001); fewer days of postoperative temperature >38.0°C (P < .01); fewer postoperative complications (P < .05); and better liver and renal function on postoperative days 7 (P < .05 each). Conclusions: Simultaneous LSH is safe for selected patients with HCC and hypersplenism associated with liver cirrhosis.",

Results: There were 54, 40, and 26 patients with Type I, II, and III HCCs, respectively. Among these, eight patients developed ruptured tumors within 2 weeks after TACE, including one, two, and five patients with type I, II, and III ruptured HCCs, respectively. Patients with type III HCCs had a shorter median survival time than patients with type I-II HCCs. Conclusions: Patients with type III HCCs might have a higher re-rupture rate and benefit less from emergency arterial embolization procedures than patients with type I-II HCCs.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To identify predictive factors associated with long-term patient and graft survival (> 15 years) in liver transplant recipients. Methods: Medical charts of all de novo adult liver transplant recipients (n = 140) who were transplanted in Hamburg between 1997 and 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 155 transplantations were identified in this time period (15 re-transplantations). Twenty-six orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients were early lost to follow-up due to moving to other places within 1 year after transplantation. All remaining 114 patients were included in the analysis. The following recipient factors were analysed: Age, sex, underlying liver disease, pre-OLT body mass index (BMI), and levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, creatinine and gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT), as well as warm and cold ischemia times. Furthermore, the following donor factors were assessed: Age, BMI, cold ischemia time and warm ischemia time. All surviving patients were followed until December 2014. We divided patients into groups according to their underlying diagnosis: (1) hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 5, 4%); (2) alcohol toxic liver disease (n = 25, 22.0%); (3) primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 6, 5%); (4) autoimmune liver diseases (n = 7, 6%); (5) hepatitis C virus cirrhosis (n = 15, 13%); (6) hepatitis B virus cirrhosis (n = 21, 19%); and (7) other (n = 35, 31%). The group \"other\" included rare diagnoses, such as acute liver failure, unknown liver failure, stenosis and thrombosis of the arteria hepatica, polycystic liver disease, Morbus Osler and Caroli disease. Results: The majority of patients were male (n = 70, 61%). Age and BMI at the time point of transplantation ranged from 16 years to 69 years (median: 53 years) and from 15 kg/m2 to 33 kg/m2 (median: 24), respectively. Sixty-six OLT recipients (58%) experienced a follow-up of 15 years after transplantation. Recipient's age (P = 0.009) and BMI (P = 0.029) were identified as risk factors for death by χ2-test. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed BMI or age above the median as predictors of decreased long-term survival (P = 0.008 and P = 0.020). Hepatitis B as underlying disease showed a trend for improved long-term survival (P = 0.049, χ2-test, P = 0.055; Kaplan-Meier analysis, Log rank). Pre-transplant bilirubin, creatinine, ALT and gamma-GT levels were not associated with survival in these patients of the pre-era of the model of end stage liver disease. Conclusion: The recipients' age and BMI were predictors of long-term survival after OLT, as well as hepatitis B as underlying disease. In contrast, donors' age and BMI were not associated with decreased survival. These findings indicate that recipient factors especially have a high impact on long-term outcome after liver transplantation.",

Objective: To measure morbidity and mortality and assess predictors of outcome after hepatectomy. Design: Descriptive study. Setting: Tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia with well established hepatobiliary surgery unit. Patients and methods: All patients undergoing liver resection in our institute during 2006-2014. Data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Main outcomes measure(s): Postoperative morbidity and 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were risk factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Results: Data on 77 resections were collected; 56 patients (72.7%) had a malignant etiology, mainly colorectal liver metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma (45.5% and 14.3% respectively). Complications developed following 30 resections (39.0%), with the majority being Clavien grades I-III. In the univariate analysis, predicting factors were the total bilirubin level preoperatively, operative time, extent of resection (i.e., major resection), use of epidural anesthesia, and postoperative liver dysfunction. In the multivariate analysis, the Schindl liver dysfunction score showed the strongest correlation with the development of complications (P=.006). The 90-day postoperative mortality was 5.2% (4/77 patients); 3 patients fulfilled the 50:50 liver dysfunction criteria. Significant predictors were concurrent intra-abdominal surgery, postoperative liver dysfunction, and multiple complications. Conclusion: Factors that predicted development of complications were elevated total bilirubin level preoperatively, operative time, extent of the resection, use of epidural anesthesia and a postoperative need for blood transfusion. Liver resection is a safe and feasible option at our center. Limitations: The small number of indications for resection and consequent reduction in variety of risk factors limited ability to make inferences. Additionally, only a handful of cases were performed laparoscopically.",

    "Abstract": "CDKN2A (p16INK4A/MTS1) and CDKN2B (p15INK4B/MTS2) have recently been shown to be potent inhibitors of the cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinase-4 complex. Both genes are candidates for the putative tumour suppressor genes located at chromosome 9p21 and are frequently inactivated in many human cancers through homozygous deletion. More recently, another reported pathway of inactivation involves loss of transcription associated with de novo methylation of the 5' CpG island of p16/MTS1 and p15/MTS2 in human cancers. We examined a total of 34 tumours from 30 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for deletion, mutation and DNA methylation of these two genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, sequence analysis and Southern blot. Homozygous deletions of P16/MTS1 exon 1 were only identified in 1 of 30 cases (3%). Homozygous deletions of p15 exon 1 or exon 2 were found in 7 of 30 cases (13%). Automated sequencing analysis of p16 exon 1 and 2 and p15 exon 1 and 2 failed to demonstrate mutations in either p16 or p15 in any of these specimens. No aberrant 5' CpG island hypermethylation of p16 or p15 was found in any of the primary tumours by Southern blot. These data suggest that the p16/MTS1 gene has a limited role in HCC. However, deletions of the p15/MTS2 gene are found in 13% HCC and might be involved in a subset of HCC.",

In addition to a diverse molecular background, HCC subtypes also show differences in their metabolic profiles, suggesting that prevention and treatment might require the integration of multiple different approaches. We here analyzed the response of two HCC cell lines representative of different virus-related etiology, namely Hep3B (HBV+) and HUH7 (permissive to HCV replication) to sorafenib treatment. Our findings suggest that virus-related specificities influence treatment response in HCC, along with molecular, metabolic and microenvironmental factors. These differences have to be taken into account in the design of future clinical trial aimed to improve HCC patients' outcome.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Spondias mombin L. is a tree used in folk medicine in Nigeria for the treatment of hepatitis. This study was carried out to comparatively evaluate the hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of S. mombin leaf and stem (SML and SMS) methanolic extracts in a rat model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity. Methods: Forty-two rats were distributed into seven groups. Groups A and B received water; groups C and D received 500 and 1000 mg/kg SML extract, respectively; groups E and F received 500 and 1000 mg/kg SMS extract, respectively; and group G received 100 mg/kg silymarin. Water, the two extracts, and silymarin were administered daily by oral gavage for 7 days. Hepatotoxicity was induced in groups B to G by the administration of CCl4 once on the seventh day. After 48 h, rats were sacrificed, and tissues and serum samples were examined for histological and biochemical indices of hepatotoxicity. Results: Administration of CCl4 resulted in liver injury with significant elevation in the hepatocellular injury markers alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TBIL), and conjugated bilirubin (CBIL), associated with a significant reduction in total circulatory protein. Pretreatment with SML and SMS extracts at both doses significantly ameliorated liver injury; lowered ALT, AST, ALP, TBIL, and CBIL levels; elevated cellular glutathione levels as well as catalase and superoxide dismutase activities; and decreased the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the potential therapeutic benefit of S. mombin in xenobiotic-induced hepatotoxicity.",

We found a case of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) in a 23-year-old male patient after an ileal J pouch-anal anastomosis for FAP. He also had fundic gland polyposis at the fundus and upper corpus in his stomach. Genetic counseling was rejected by his mother. The patient's condition was followed up routinely in the surgical outpatient clinic. Liver dysfunction was detected by blood examination 5 years after surgery. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography also showed a single nodular type of the HCC at S8 in his liver. Partial hepatectomy at S8 was performed and the postoperative course has been uneventful.",

    "Abstract": "Hereditary etiologies of pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancers are increasingly recognized. An estimated >10% of pancreatic and increasing number of hepatobiliary cancers are hereditary. The cumulative risk of hereditary pancreatic cancer ranges from measurable but negligible in cystic fibrosis to a sobering 70% in cases of hereditary pancreatitis. Candidates for pancreatic cancer surveillance are those with a risk pancreatic cancer estimated to be >10-fold that of the normal population. Screening for pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals is typically performed by endoscopic ultrasound and should begin at least 10 years prior to the age of the youngest affected relative. Disease states known to be associated with increased risk of hepatocellular cancer include hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, porphyria, and α1-antitrypsin deficiency, with relative risks as high as 36-fold. Although much less is known about hereditary bile-duct cancers, Muir-Torre syndrome and bile salt export pump deficiency are diseases whose association with hereditary carcinogenesis is under investigation.",

    "Abstract": "The spectrum of p53 mutations differs among human cancer types. We have hypothesized that the p53 mutational spectrum observed in particular tumor types reflects the functional ability of different p53 mutants to modulate wild-type (WT) p53-dependent gene transcription. Missense p53 mutants representing several mutational hotspot codons were cotransfected with WT p53 and analysed for their effects on p53-dependent transactivation of a reporter construct containing a specific p53 binding sequence (PG13-CAT) in human tumor cell lines lacking endogenous p53. Our results show that the ability of p53 mutants to inhibit WT p53-mediated transactivation is cell type dependent. In cell lines derived from a lung adenocarcinoma and a mesothelioma, the transactivation function of WT p53 was strongly inhibited by all p53 mutants examined. However, in cell lines derived from a prostate carcinoma and an osteosarcoma, the mutants examined generally had only minimal dominant negative effects. In cell lines derived from a hepatocellular carcinoma and an ovarian carcinoma, two mutants (248trp and 273his) enhanced WT p53-mediated transactivation of the reporter construct. Additional mutants retained the ability to inhibit WT p53-mediated transactivation in these cell lines. In addition, in a series of four breast tumor cell lines, the p53 mutants examined had similar effects on WT p53 transactivation ability including enhanced transactivation activity in the 273his cotransfectants. The p53 mutants were incapable of transactivating the PG13-CAT reporter in the absence of WT p53 expression. Therefore, the dominant negative effects of p53 mutants on WT p53 function may vary depending on the particular cell type. In addition, mutants with stronger inhibitory capabilities may confer a selective advantage during the tumorigenic process.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer subtyping has mainly relied on pathological and molecular means. Massively parallel sequencing-enabled subtyping requires genomic markers to be developed based on global features rather than individual mutations for effective implementation. Methods: In the present study, the whole genome sequences (WGS) of 110 liver cancers of Japanese patients published with different pathologies were analyzed with respect to their single nucleotide variations (SNVs) comprising both gain-of-heterozygosity (GOH) and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) mutations, the signatures of combined GOH and LOH mutations, along with recurrent copy number variations (CNVs). Results: The results, obtained based on the WGS sequences as well as the Exome subset within the WGSs that covered ~ 2.0% of the WGS and the AluScan-subset within the WGSs that were amplifiable by Alu element-consensus primers and covered ~ 2.1% of the WGS, indicated that the WGS samples could be employed with the mutational parameters of SNV load, LOH%, the Signature α%, and survival-associated recurrent CNVs (srCNVs) as genomic markers for subtyping to stratify liver cancer patients prognostically into the long and short survival subgroups. The usage of the AluScan-subset data, which could be implemented with sub-micrograms of DNA samples and vastly reduced sequencing analysis task, outperformed the usage of WGS data when LOH% was employed as stratifying criterion. Conclusions: Thus genomic subtyping performed with novel genomic markers identified in this study was effective in predicting patient-survival duration, with cohorts of hepatocellular carcinomas alone and those including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Such relatively heterogeneity-insensitive genomic subtyping merits further studies with a broader spectrum of cancers.",

    "Abstract": "As social distancing and strict stay-at-home orders have been instituted to slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), unintentional outcomes among those with chronic diseases including screening for the lethal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may be occurring. We aimed to describe the changes in liver care before and after COVID-19 restricted access to health care. We obtained data on the number of liver clinic visits, abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging using electronic query or clinic registry at three medical centers in the United States, Japan, and Singapore for the following periods: February 1 to March 14, 2018, 2019, and 2020; and March 15 to May 1, 2018, 2019, and 2020. We performed trend analysis using logistic regression. In total, 14,403 visits were made to the liver clinics at the three centers: 5,900 in 2018, 5,270 in 2019, and 3,233 in 2020. Overall, there were no significant changes in the distribution of males and females between February 1 and May 1 from 2018 to 2020, but there was a lower proportion of seniors ages 65 years and older (P < 0.001). There were significant decreasing trends in the total number of liver clinic visits overall (p-trend = 0.038) and in the subanalysis for chronic hepatitis B, C, and other liver diseases. HCC/cirrhosis visits also dropped from 883 to 538 (39.07% decrease) overall and 665 to 355 (46.62% decrease) for the US site. In addition, there was a significant decreasing trend in the number of abdominal ultrasounds (P-trend = 0.004) and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (P-trend = 0.007) performed overall. Conclusion: Liver clinic visits, hepatoma surveillance, and diagnostic abdominal imaging fell dramatically as social distancing measures were instituted. Care providers must find ways to recall patients for important care monitoring, including HCC surveillance.",

Although no samples showed the homozygous deletion of the p16INK4A gene, we detected intragenic mutations of the p16INK4A gene in 3 HCCs and one HCC cell line, which led to an amino-acid substitution or a frameshift. In 2 HCC samples with mis-sense mutations of the p16INK4A gene, loss of heterozygosity on 9p22 was also detected, suggesting that the loss of function of p16 was induced during hepatocarcinogenesis. On the other hand, amplification or rearrangement of the CDK4 gene was not detected in any samples examined in this study. These results indicated that the mutations or deletions of the p16INK4A gene are not frequent, but may play a role in a sub-set of human HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the major risk factors include chronic infections with the hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) virus, and exposure to dietary aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) or alcohol consumption. Multiple genetic and epigenetic changes are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC, for example, somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene (TP53) and the activation of the WNT signal transduction pathway. AFB(1) frequently induces G:C to T:A transversions at the third base in codon 249 of TP53 and cooperates with HBV in causing p53 mutations in HCC. The detection of TP53 mutant DNA in plasma is a biomarker of both AFB(1) exposure and HCC risk. Chronic infection with HBV and HCV viruses, and oxyradical disorders including hemochromatosis, also generate reactive oxygen/nitrogen species that can both damage DNA and mutate cancer-related genes such as TP53. Certain mutant p53 proteins may exhibit a 'gain of oncogenic function'. The p53 biological network is a key responder to this oxidative and nitrosative stress. Depending on the extent of the DNA damage, p53 regulates the transcription of protective antioxidant genes and with extensive DNA damage, transactivates pro-oxidant genes that contribute to apoptosis. The X gene of HBV (HBx) is the most common open reading frame integrated into the host genome in HCC and the integrated HBx is frequently mutated. Mutant HBx proteins still retain their ability to bind to p53, and attenuate DNA repair and p53-mediated apoptosis. In summary, both viruses and chemicals are implicated in the etiology of TP53 mutations during the molecular pathogenesis of HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The combination of computed tomography with hepatic arteriography and arterial portography (CTHA/CTAP) can detect additional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules undetected by conventional dynamic CT. Methods: In this single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 280 patients who were diagnosed as having HCC by conventional dynamic CT, and eligible for radiofrequency ablation (RFA), to undergo CTHA/CTAP before treatment, or to the control group. Newly detected HCC nodules by CTHA/CTAP were intended to be ablated completely. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival and the key secondary end point was overall survival. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Those with nonablated nodules were treated as for recurrence. Results: A total of 75 nodules were newly diagnosed as HCC by CTHA/CTAP in 45 patients. Three patients (one in the CTHA/CTAP group and two in the control group) who refused treatment were excluded from all analyses. The cumulative recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 60.1, 29.0, and 18.9% in the CTHA/CTAP group and 52.2, 29.7, and 23.1% in the control group, respectively (P=0.66 by log-rank test; hazard ratio, 0.94 for CTHA/CTAP vs. control; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-1.22). The cumulative overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 79.7 and 56.4% in the CTHA/CTAP group and 86.8 and 60.1% in the control group, respectively (P=0.50; hazard ratio, 1.15, 95% CI, 0.77-1.71). Conclusions: CTHA/CTAP may detect recurrent lesions earlier. However, CTHA/CTAP before RFA did not improve cumulative recurrence-free survival or overall survival.",

    "Abstract": "Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10q has been reported in hepatoma. Areas with a high rate of loss of genetic material could harbor putative tumor suppressor genes. PTEN/MMAC1, a candidate tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 10q23.3, has recently been identified and found to be homozygously deleted or mutated in several different types of human tumors. To determine whether the PTEN/MMAC1 gene is a target of 10q loss of heterozygosity in hepatoma, we examined 42 primary hepatomas for mutations in PTEN/MMAC1 by using nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the RNA and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of all genomic exons. Although 2 of 42 hepatoma tissues had aberrant transcripts, 5 matched noncancerous liver tissues also had aberrant transcripts. Southern blot analysis of the entire genomic DNA revealed no genomic change. Therefore, like the TSG101 or FHIT gene, aberrant transcripts of PTEN/MMAC1 using the nested RT-PCR method were a common phenomenon for both cancerous and noncancerous liver tissues, which may not be related to oncogenesis. None of the 42 cases had small deletions, point mutations, or insertions. Our results suggest that the PTEN/MMAC1 gene may not play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background/aims: P2/MS is known as a simple, accurate, and noninvasive marker for determination of the degree of hepatic fibrosis in patients with viral hepatitis. We aimed to validate P2/MS in patients with HCC. Methods: Consecutive HCC patients who underwent surgical resection between June 2007 and March 2009 at Seoul National University Hospital were enrolled. Fibrosis stage was reviewed and assessed according to METAVIR scoring. P2/MS values [platelet count (10(9)/L)](2)/[monocyte fraction (%)(x)segmented neutrophil fraction (%)] and other noninvasive fibrosis scoring systems were calculated. Results: A total of 171 patients were included; seven patients with METAVIR F1, 31 with F2, 41 with F3, and 92 with F4. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of P2/MS was 0.804 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.681~0.927] for detection of significant fibrosis (F2-F4) and 0.769 (95% CI, 0.698~0.839) for detection of histological cirrhosis (F4). At a value < 62, P2/MS detected significant fibrosis with a specificity of 85.7% (95% CI, 42.0~99.2) and a positive likelihood ratio of 4.268 (95% CI, 0.692~26.309); and at a value > 115, P2/MS ruled out significant fibrosis with a sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI, 84.4~94.1) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.34 (95% CI, 0.106~0.095). P2/MS had a superior efficacy for detection of hepatic fibrosis in patients with HCC compared to the other noninvasive panels. Conclusions: P2/MS can accurately detect fibrosis in patients with HCC. Thus, P2/MS might be utilized as a noninvasive index reflecting the degree of hepatic fibrosis in HCC patients.",

But real-world data is still not enough, especially in Asia. Aim: To investigate the efficacy and safety of DAA-based regimens in a real-life setting in China. Methods: This study included 366 patients infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3, with or without cirrhosis, who were observed between May 2015 and December 2018. They were treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (SOF) (genotype 1) with or without ribavirin (RBV), SOF and RBV (genotype 2), or SOF and daclatasvir (genotype 3), with or without RBV, for 12 or more wk. The participants' sustained virological responses (SVR) at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) was the primary endpoint. The occurrence of adverse events and drug-drug interactions were recorded. Results: In the 366 patients, genotype 1 (59.0%) was the most common genotype, followed by genotypes 2 (34.4%) and 3 (6.6%). Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 154 (42.1%) patients. Fifty (13.7%) patients were treatment-experienced. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that SVR12 was 86.3% (316/366). For modified intention-to-treat analysis, SVR12 was achieved in 96.6% of overall patients (316/327), 96.3% in patients with genotype 1, 97.5% in those with genotype 2, and 95.0% in those with genotype 3. Most of the treatment failures were due to lack of follow-up (3 cases had non-responses, 1 had virological breakthrough, 11 relapsed and 36 did not participate in the follow-up). There was no significant difference in SVR between different genotypes and liver statuses (P < 0.05). Patients with lower alanine aminotransferase levels at baseline who achieved an end of treatment response were more likely to achieve SVR12 (P < 0.05). High SVR was observed regardless of age, gender, liver status, alpha-fetoprotein, HCV RNA levels or history of antiviral therapy (P > 0.05 for all). The cumulative hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence and recurrence rate after using the DAAs was 0.9%. Most of the adverse events were mild. We found two cases of special adverse events. One case involved facial and bilateral lower extremity edema, and the other case showed an interesting change in lipid levels while on medication. No severe adverse events were noted. Conclusion: The DAA-based regimens tested in this study have excellent effectiveness and safety in all patients infected with HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3, including those with cirrhosis.",

    "Abstract": "Abnormal function of p53 is commonly associated with various cancer formations. High-grade and late-stage bladder cancers have been reported to have mutated or become inactive p53 when using immunohistochemical stains. Recently, p53 codon 72 polymorphism was extensively studied to determine the risk factors responsible for cancer formation. There was a general population of codon 72 sequence polymorphism of the wild type p53. A single base change from G to C caused the alteration of amino acid residue 72 from arginine to proline. The arginine form is considered to be a significant risk factor in the development of cancer. However, various reports had indicated discrepancies with regard to this polymorphism; some showed no significant difference between the control and cancer groups, while other series were associated with high risks in the proline form homozygotes. To resolve the undefined distribution of this polymorphism in bladder cancers, 58 patients with bladder cancer were enrolled onto this study. When checked using the Chi-squared test (P = 0.952) there were no differences between the control subjects and bladder cancer patients in the distribution of polymorphism. However, proline form homozygotes were more frequently found in the invasive group than the non-invasive group by Fisher's exact test (25% and 2.9%, respectively, P < 0.001). More than 70% of the non-invasive bladder cancers were the arginine form homozygotes. This result is consistent with those reported for hepatocellular carcinoma that showed a history of chronic liver disease and proline form homozygotes in a report by Yu et al. Our data suggest that proline form homozygotes are associated with invasive bladder cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Angiogenesis has been associated with hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alcohol promotes liver hypoxia, a trigger of angiogenesis. We aimed to evaluate whether the frequency of three polymorphisms in hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and KDR (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) genes was higher in alcoholics presenting liver disease (ALD) and ALD patients who developed HCC. Materials and methods: Functional HIF-1α 1744C/T, VEGFA 2578C/A, and KDR 1416A/T single-nucleotide polymorphisms were studied in 125 ALD patients and 88 heavy drinkers without liver disease (NLD). ALD patients were followed up to 9 years or until they died; 26 patients developed HCC. Results: ALD patients were older than NLD (56±11 vs. 50±13, P<0.001), but drank less (215±164 vs. 331±293 g/day, P<0.001). No differences were found between HIF-1α, VEGFA, or KDR allelic frequencies or genotypes, isolated or simultaneously, between ALD and NLD. In ALD patients, those who developed HCC had a higher KDR 1416T allele frequency (36 vs. 15%, P=0.004; odds ratio 2.72; 95% confidence interval 1.35-5.46). There was also a progressive increase in genotypes with one or two T alleles in patients who developed HCC: AA 50 vs. 73%, AT 35 vs. 23%, and TT 15 vs. 4% (P=0.009). The simultaneous presence of KDR 1416T and VEGFA 2578A was associated with an increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 3.088; 95% confidence interval 1.20-7.96). Conclusion: Genetic polymorphisms in proangiogenic factors did not associate with the risk of ALD in heavy drinkers. However, KDR and VEFGA polymorphisms may confer an increased risk of HCC in patients with ALD.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Studies on the epidemiology of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in the Chinese population are lacking. We aimed to determine the epidemiology of PBC in Hong Kong (HK) with a population of 7.3 million. Methods: We retrieved data from the electronic database of the HK Hospital Authority, the only public healthcare provider in Hong Kong. PBC cases between 2000 and 2015 were identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 code. We estimated the age-/sex-adjusted incidence rate and prevalence of PBC, and analyzed the adverse outcomes (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplantation, and death). Results: One thousand and sixteen PBC patients aged ≥20 years were identified (female-to-male ratio 4:1; median age 60.6 years, interquartile range (IQR) 51.8-72.6 years; median follow-up 5.6 years, IQR 1.6-8.7 years). The average age/sex-adjusted annual incidence rate and prevalence were 8.4 per million person-years and 56.4 per million, respectively. Between 2000 and 2015, the age/sex-adjusted annual incidence rate increased from 6.7 to 8.1 per million person-years (Poisson P=0.002), while age/sex-adjusted prevalence increased from 31.1 to 82.3 per million (Poisson P<0.001). Fifty patients developed HCC, and 49 underwent liver transplantation. Case fatality risk decreased from 10.8 to 6.4% (Poisson P=0.003). The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 81.5 and 78.3%, whereas the transplant-free survival rates were 78.0% and 74.3%, respectively. Increasing age, cirrhosis and being treatment-naïve were associated with lower transplant-free survival. Conclusions: There is a considerable increase in the incidence and prevalence of PBC in the Chinese population over the past 16 years, with significant morbidity and mortality.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate potential diagnostic or prognostic markers for early HCC by applying bioinformatic analysis. Methods: The gene expression profiles of early HCC and normal tissues from a TCGA dataset were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and then analysed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis. The integrated genes were selected to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and determine the hub genes. The prognostic impact of the hub genes was then analysed. Results: A total of 508 integrated genes were selected from the 615 DEGs and 8956 genes in the turquoise module. A PPI network was constructed, and the top 20 hub genes, including apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG), vitamin K-dependent protein Z (PROZ), secreted phosphoprotein 24 (SPP2) and fetuin-B (FETUB), were identified. Only PROZ was significantly associated with the prognosis of early HCC. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of PROZ was decreased in early HCC compared with normal liver controls, and low PROZ expression might result in poor overall survival of early HCC.",

    "Abstract": "The Syrian crisis has had a devastating impact on displaced populations and among host communities in neighboring countries such as Jordan. Many of these individuals are at risk for non-communicable diseases (NCD) and mental health disorders, yet do not have access to services designed to manage or prevent these conditions. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a non-communicable disease (NCD) awareness educational intervention and an integrated NCD and mental health education intervention on reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Jordanians and displaced Syrians. This natural experiment study was conducted in three health centers in Irbid, Jordan with 213 Syrian participants and 382 Jordanians. Participants were assigned to one of three study conditions: the Healthy Community Clinic (HCC), a non-communicable disease educational intervention; the HCC with added mental health awareness sessions; standard healthcare. CVD risk factors were assessed at baseline, 12 and 18 months. The HCC education group yielded significant improvements in three CVD risk factors including: body mass index (BMI) -1.91 (95% CI: -2.09, -1.73); systolic blood pressure (SBP) -12.80 mmHg (95% CI: -16.35, -9.25); and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) -5.78 mmHg (95% CI: -7.96, -3.60) compared to standard care. The HCC-mental health treatment arm also demonstrated significant improvements in BMI, SBP, and DBP compared to standard care. Significant improvements in fasting blood glucose -20.32 (CI: -28.87, -11.77) and HbA1c -0.43 (-0.62, -0.24) were also illustrated in the HCC-mental health treatment arm. The HCC-mental health group sustained greater reductions in CVD risk than the HCC education group at 18-months. This study is among the first to our knowledge illustrating an integrated health and mental health educational intervention can reduce CVD risk among Syrian refugees and Jordanians. Continued investment and research in CVD prevention interventions is needed to enhance health, reduce costs, and have lasting benefits for conflict-affected individuals and communities.",

The molecular target of miR-144 was identified using a computer algorithm and confirmed experimentally. Results: We found that the levels of miR-144 were frequently downregulated in human HCC tissues and cell lines, and overexpression of miR-144 dramatically inhibited HCC metastasis, invasion, cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance. We further verified the SMAD4 as a novel and direct target of miR-144 in HCCs. Conclusion: Taken together, overexpression of miR-144 or downregulation of SMAD4 may prove beneficial as therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment.",

Methods: A total of 195 patients with CHC were subdivided into the following two groups: 105 HCV cirrhotic patients with HCC and 90 HCV cirrhotic patients without HCC. Sixty apparently healthy subjects served as the control group. The serum VEGF and endocan were assessed by ELISA. Results: The mean serum endocan level was 4257.6± 847.6 pg/mL in HCC patients, compared to 2099.2± 459.6 pg/mL in liver cirrhosis patients without HCC. VEGF levels in the HCC group were non-significantly higher than those of the non-HCC group, and control group. Endocan at cut-off value 2967 pg/ml had higher sensitivity and higher specificity in diagnosis of HCC than AFP and VEGF. The median follow up period was 9 months, survival curve analysis was done in HCC group and showed that probability of survival among HCC group with higher levels of VEGF and endocan were significantly lower than that patients with low levels. In HCC patients, elevated serum endocan levels were significantly associated with poor hepatic functions and a greater number and size of tumours. Multivariate analysis showed that serum endocan levels (≥4000 pg/ml), as well as elevated serum fetoprotein (>100 ng/dl), were independent prognostic biomarkers for mortality. Conclusion: Endocan may be a useful diagnostic marker for HCC and a good predictor of mortality, especially when combined with AFP and VEGF.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the p53 gene are frequent genetic alterations in human hepatocellular carcinoma. We have examined 38 hepatocellular carcinoma cases from Taiwan for the presence of p53 alterations in exons 5-8 of the gene using the single-stranded conformational polymorphism method and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. Using the single-stranded conformational polymorphism method, we found mutations in 16 (42.1%) cases. Twelve mutations were found in exon 5, three in exon 7, and one in exon 8. No mutations were found in exon 6. Sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products showed that all mutations in exon 5 were clustered at codon 166 and were T/A transversions resulting in an amino acid change from serine to threonine, identifying a new hot-spot for point mutations in the p53 gene. The mutations in exon 7 were all at codon 249, and were G/T transversions leading to an amino acid change of arginine to serine. Finally, the mutation at exon 8 was a G-to-T transversion at codon 286 leading to a stop codon. These data indicate that mutations of the p53 gene may be important in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma and that, in contrast to other tumors, the mutations of the p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinomas can be clustered in a specific codon of the gene.",

One sample [human colon cancer (HCC) 278] was found to have a TP53 mutation altering the amino acid glutamine 167 in exon 5. A deletion of 2 bases changed glutamine 167 (CAG) to alanine (GCA) and the resulting frame-shift produced an in-frame stop codon at amino acid 179.

    "Abstract": "Inactivating point mutations and small deletions in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found in human liver and lung tumor--derived cell lines and tumors. However, little evidence has been reported concerning inactivation or mutation of the p53 gene in mouse primary tumors. To examine CD-1 mouse liver and lung tumors for mutations in the p53 gene, we first sequenced p53 introns 5-8 so that polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing primers located within the introns could be prepared. Use of these primers prevented amplification of the mouse p53 pseudogene and allowed sequencing of exons 5-8 in their entirety as well as their intron-exon junctions. DNA isolated from CD-1 mouse tumors was amplified and directly sequenced using nested primers. Nine spontaneous hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and 34 chemically induced HCCs (induced by single intraperitoneal injections of N-nitrosodiethylamine [DEN] [8 HCCs], 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene [DMBA] [8 HCCs], 4-aminoazobenzene [8 HCCs], and N-OH-2-acetylaminofluorene [10 HCCs]) were examined for mutations in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. In addition, 12 spontaneous, 10 DMBA-induced, and 13 DEN-induced lung adenocarcinomas or adenomas were analyzed for mutations. No mutations were found in any of the tumors examined. However, a mutation was demonstrated at codon 135 in the positive-control plasmid LTRp53cG(val). The results of this study suggest that inactivation of p53 is unlikely to play a major role in murine lung or liver carcinogenesis. However, inactivation of p53 may occur at a very low frequency, or it may occur as a late event and therefore be present in only a very small number of the tumor cells, rendering it undetectable by this method. Lastly, although few p53-inactivating mutations are found outside of exons 5-8 in human tumors, it is possible that these murine tumors contained mutations outside of this region and were therefore missed by our approach.",

    "Abstract": "Structural alterations of the p53 gene were investigated in chemically induced rat hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), hyperplastic hepatic nodules (HPNs), and cell lines derived from rat neoplastic and normal liver cells. The mutations were detected by GC-clamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using DNA that had been amplified from p53 mRNA by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. This method enabled us to find single-base changes within the p53 gene without using radioisotopes. The presence of mutations was subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing. No mutations were detected in six primary HCCs and 12 HPNs induced by the Solt and Farber regimen (Nature 236: 701-703, 1976), suggesting that p53 gene mutations do not play a major role in rat hepatic carcinogenesis. However, five of seven HCC cell lines and one of two cell lines derived from normal liver cells had the mutated p53 gene and had lost the normal p53 gene. Five cell lines had a G-->T transversion at various codons, whereas one line had a 21-base deletion in exon 5. Therefore, we conclude that p53 gene mutations may occur in vitro during establishment of the cell lines or may be derived from very small populations within the primary tumors.",

Further workup demonstrated hepatocellular dysfunction and liver biopsy showed expansion of portal tracts by lymphocytes and eosinophils consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction. Nafcillin and related antibiotics were withdrawn, and her symptoms resolved 3 months later. We searched PubMed using terms of \"nafcillin cholestasis\" and \"nafcillin hepatitis\", and a review of the literature showed other reports of nafcillin-induced hepatitis and cholestasis. Avoidance and on occasion the guarded use of glucocorticoids can lead to recovery from the insult. This case report shows that while rare, nafcillin can cause cholestatic hepatitis through a likely eosinophil-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of this reaction.",

In this study, we performed a two-stage study to screen BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) with 7580 cancer cases and 4874 cancer-free controls, consisting of a discovery stage with 70 familial breast cancer cases and a subsequent validation stage with 7510 cases (3217 breast cancer, 1133 cervical cancer, 2044 hepatocellular carcinoma, and 1116 colorectal cancer). 48 variants were obtained from 70 familial breast cancer cases after BRCA1/2 exon detection, and finally, 20 pathogenic variants or VUS were selected for subsequent validation. Four recurrent variants in sporadic cases (BRCA1 c.4801A>T, BRCA1 c.3257del, BRCA1 c.440del, and BRCA2 c.7409dup) were identified and three of them were labeled Class 5 by ENIGMA. Two variants (BRCA1 c.3257del and c.440del) were specific in breast cancer cases, while BRCA2 c.7409dup and c.4307T>C were detected in two hepatocellular carcinoma patients and the BRCA1 c.4801A>T variant in one cervical cancer patient, respectively. Moreover, BRCA1 c.3257del was the most frequent variant observed in Chinese sporadic breast cancer and showed increased proliferation of BRCA1 c.3257del-overexpressing triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231) in vitro. In addition to the known founder deleterious mutations, our findings highlight that the recurrently pathogenic variants in breast cancer cases could be taken as candidate genetic screening loci for a more efficient genetic screening of the Chinese population.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common malignant tumor in the liver, grows and metastasizes rapidly. Despite advances in treatment modalities, the five-year survival rate of HCC remains less than 30%. We sought genetic mutations that may affect the oncogenic properties of HCC, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data analysis. We found that the GNAQ T96S mutation (threonine 96 to serine alteration of the Gαq protein) was present in 12 out of 373 HCC patients (3.2%). To examine the effect of the GNAQ T96S mutation on HCC, we transfected the SK-Hep-1 cell line with the wild-type or the mutant GNAQ T96S expression vector. Transfection with the wild-type GNAQ expression vector enhanced anchorage-independent growth, migration, and the MAPK pathways in the SK-Hep-1 cells compared to control vector transfection. Moreover, cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, and the MAPK pathways were further enhanced in the SK-Hep-1 cells transfected with the GNAQ T96S expression vector compared to the wild-type GNAQ-transfected cells. In silico structural analysis shows that the substitution of the GNAQ amino acid threonine 96 with a serine may destabilize the interaction between the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein and GNAQ. This may reduce the inhibitory effect of RGS on GNAQ signaling, enhancing the GNAQ signaling pathway. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping analysis for Korean HCC patients shows that the GNAQ T96S mutation was found in only one of the 456 patients (0.22%). Our data suggest that the GNAQ T96S hotspot mutation may play an oncogenic role in HCC by potentiating the GNAQ signal transduction pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Liver cancer is one of most deadly cancers worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major histological subtype of liver cancers. As cancer is a genetic disease, genetic lesions play a major role in HCC tumorigenesis and progression. Although significant progress has been made to uncover genetic alterations in HCCs, our understanding of genetics involved in the initiation and progression of HCC is far from complete. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has provided a new paradigm in biomedical research to delineate the genetic basis of human diseases. While identification of cancer somatic mutations has been serendipitous, genome sequencing has provided an unbiased approach to systematically catalog somatic mutations and elucidate the mechanisms of tumourigenesis. A number of recently published NGS studies on HCCs have not only confirmed previously known mutations in CTNNB1 and TP53 in HCC, but also identified novel genetic alterations in HCC including mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation. WNT, cell cycle and chromatin remodeling pathways have emerged as key oncogenic drivers in HCCs. The frequently altered genes and pathways in HCC reflect classical cancer hallmarks. These findings have started to depict a genetic landscape in HCC and will facilitate development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of this deadly disease.",

    "Abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the expression and biological function of miR‑3653 in HCC remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that miR‑3653 expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues and cells using qRT‑PCR. A decreased miR‑3653 level was associated with unfavorable clinical features and poor prognosis of HCC patients. MTT, BrdU, Transwell and western blot assays showed that miR‑3653 overexpression inhibited the growth, migration, invasion and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCCLM3 cells while its knockdown promoted the growth and metastatic ability of Hep3B cells. In vivo experiments showed that miR‑3653 overexpression inhibited the subcutaneous and the lung metastasis of HCCLM3 cells in nude mice. Mechanistically, integrin‑β1 (ITGB1) was identified to be the downstream target of miR‑3653 in HCC. ITGB1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of miR‑3653 on the growth, metastasis and EMT of HCCLM3 cells.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Telomerase expression and the maintenance of a critical telomere length (TL) in cancer initiation indicates that telomere shortening and telomerase expression initiates cancer by induction of chromosomal instability. Methods: Telomerase activity, TL and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression were investigated in 58 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 17 chronic hepatitis patients by the telomerase repeat amplification protocol, Southern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Telomerase was positive in 76% of HCC and 11.8% of chronic hepatitis patients (P<0.0001). The mean telomere length (MTL) in HCC was significantly shorter compared with chronic hepatitis (P<0.0001). The MTL was not significantly different in HCC patients with and without cirrhosis (P=0.77). In hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and non-B non-C-related HCC groups, no differences were found in telomerase activity and MTL (P=0.77). hTERT, a regulator of telomerase, was, however, positive in 81% of HCCs. The correlation between telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA expression was statistically significant (P<0.0001). The MTL in telomerase-positive HCC cases was significantly shorter than the MTL in telomerase-negative cases (P<0.0001). Conclusion: The majority of HCCs exhibited telomerase activity that correlated well with hTERT expression. MTL in HCC was significantly shorter than chronic hepatitis. It was also found that shorter telomeres are present in telomerase-positive HCC cases. However, no correlation was found between telomerase activity and TL with respect to the viral status in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Commercially available targeted panels miss genomic regions frequently altered in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We sought to design and benchmark a sequencing assay for genomic screening of HCC. We designed an AmpliSeq custom panel targeting all exons of 33 protein-coding and two long noncoding RNA genes frequently mutated in HCC, TERT promoter, and nine genes with frequent copy number alterations. By using this panel, the profiling of DNA from fresh-frozen (n = 10, 1495×) and/or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors with low-input DNA (n = 36, 530×) from 39 HCCs identified at least one somatic mutation in 90% of the cases. Median of 2.5 (range, 0 to 74) and 3 (range, 0 to 76) mutations were identified in fresh-frozen and FFPE tumors, respectively. Benchmarked against the mutations identified from Illumina whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the corresponding fresh-frozen tumors (105×), 98% (61 of 62) and 100% (104 of 104) of the mutations from WES were detected in the 10 fresh-frozen tumors and the 36 FFPE tumors, respectively, using the HCC panel. In addition, 18 and 70 somatic mutations in coding and noncoding genes, respectively, not found by WES were identified by using our HCC panel. Copy number alterations between WES and our HCC panel showed an overall concordance of 86%. In conclusion, we established a cost-effective assay for the detection of genomic alterations in HCC.",

We constructed 14 non-phosphorylated, 11 phospho-mimetic, and 1 non-acetylated point p53 mutations and compared their transactivation ability in U-87 human glioblastoma cells by the luciferase reporter assay. Despite mutations at the phosphorylation sites, only the p53-K120R and p53-S9E mutants had marginally reduced activities. On the other hand, the Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)-luciferase reporter was more potently activated by p53-K120R than by wild-type p53 and other mutants in glioblastoma, hepatoma and esophageal carcinoma cells. This suggests that acetylation at Lys-120 of p53 negatively regulates a signaling pathway leading to NFAT activation.",

    "Abstract": "TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, with a predominance of missense mutations scattered over 200 codons. In many cancers, specific mutation patterns can be identified, which are shaped by site-specific mutagenesis and by biological selection. In tobacco-related cancers (lung, head and neck), organ-specific patterns are observed, with many mutations compatible with the ones experimentally induced by tobacco carcinogens. In several other cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mutation patterns show geographic variations between regions of high and low incidence, suggesting a role for region-specific risk factors. HCC from high-incidence regions showing also a high prevalence of a specific Ser-249 TP53 mutation is one of the most striking examples of a mutagen fingerprint. All such assessments are useful to generate clues on the mutagenic mechanisms involved in human cancer. Moreover, it has been shown that DNA retrieved from plasma can be successfully used for detection of TP53 mutations, which gives hope for earlier more accurate detection of human cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection remains a major health threat, especially in high-prevalence areas. Most infants infected by mother-to-infant HBV transmission become chronic carriers. In Taiwan, many important preventive interventions have been implemented to block the perinatal transmission of HBV in the past 35 years. The first nationwide universal HBV vaccination program was launched in Taiwan in July 1984. The three-dose HBV vaccine completion rate reached 98.1% in 2018. The prevalence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) decreased from 9.8% in pre-vaccinated period in 1984 to 0.5% in the vaccinated cohort in 2014. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in children aged 6-9 years significantly declined from 0.52 to 0.13 per 100,000 children born before and after 1984, respectively. Furthermore, we have performed a maternal HBV screening program during pregnancy since 1984, with the screening rate peaked at 93% in 2012. The HBsAg- and HBeAg-seropositive rate in pregnant women declined from 13.4% and 6.4% in 1984-1985 to 5.9% and 1.0% in 2016, respectively. To closely control perinatal HBV infection, we have administered hepatitis B immunoglobulin immediately after birth and checked the serum level of HBsAg and anti-HBs in high-risk babies born to HBsAg-seropositive mothers, irrespective of their HBeAg status, since July 2019. We have also adopted short-term antiviral treatments such as tenofovir 300 mg daily in the third trimester for highly viremic mothers and reduced the perinatal infection rates from 10.7 to 1.5%. Through all these efforts, we expect to meet the global goal of eliminating HBV infection by 2030.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Integrin α6 is an attractive diagnostic biomarker for molecular imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as it has an extremely high positive rate (approximately 94%) in clinical early-stage HCC. In this study, based on our previously identified integrin α6-targeted peptide, we developed an optimized integrin α6-targeted magnetic resonance (MR) probe dubbed DOTA(Gd)-ANADYWR for MR imaging of HCC in mice. Materials and methods: The longitudinal (R1) relaxivity of DOTA(Gd)-ANADYWR was measured on a 3.0 T MR system . The specific tumor enhancement of the agent was investigated in four distinct mouse models, including subcutaneous, orthotopic, genetically engineered and chemically induced HCC mice. Results: The R1 relaxivity value of DOTA(Gd)-ANADYWR is 5.11 mM-1s-1 at 3.0 T, which is similar to that of the nonspecific clinical agent Gadoteridol. DOTA(Gd)-ANADYWR generated superior enhanced MR signal in HCC lesions and provided complementary enhancement MR signals to the clinically available hepatobiliary MR contrast agent gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA). Importantly, DOTA(Gd)-ANADYWR could efficiently visualize small HCC lesion (approximately 1 mm) which was hardly detected by the clinical Gd-EOB-DTPA. Conclusion: These findings suggest the potential application of this integrin α6-targeted MR probe for the detection of HCC, particularly for small HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is significant in hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers due to multiple mechanisms, and this worsens the progression of chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) ratio correlates with the status of hepatosteatosis. Design: A cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Community-based annual examination in northern Taiwan. Participants: A total of 1354 participants (age 20 years or over) were enrolled after excluding participants with HCV seronegative, laboratory or questionnaires loss, moderate alcohol consumption, liver cirrhosis, tumours and postlobectomy. Outcome measures: Fatty liver was diagnosed according to echogenic findings. NAFLD included grades 1-3 fatty liver and high-degree NAFLD defined grades 2-3 fatty liver. Results: 580 males and 774 females with a mean age of 47.2 (SD=16.1) years were cross-sectionally studied. The participants with NAFLD have significantly higher levels of ALT/AST ratio, fasting glucose, triglyceride and systolic/diastolic blood pressure than non-NAFLD participants. The association between NAFLD and ALT/AST was significant even when adjusting for the metabolic syndrome (aOR 1.90; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.65; p<0.001). In patients with a high degree of NAFLD, the ALT/AST ratio was still a significant predictor for hepatosteatosis (aOR 2.44; 95% CI 1.58 to 3.77; p<0.001). Conclusions: The ALT/AST ratio could be a strong risk of hepatosteatosis in patients with chronic HCV infection.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with metastasis to the heart is uncommon. We report a rare case of left atrial metastasis of HCC which was resected palliatively as a live-saving procedure with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Despite chemoembolization, which was undertaken 11 times, cardiac metastasis occurred. Moreover, the right and left atria and left ventricle were involved simultaneously. The severe dyspnea improved dramatically after surgery. Following this, the patient underwent systemic chemotherapy and lived a life without recurrence of symptoms associated with mitral valve obstruction.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Valproic acid (VPA), a widely used epilepsy and bipolar disorder treatment, provides acute protection against haemorrhagic shock-induced mortality in a range of in vivo models through an unknown mechanism. In the liver, this effect occurs with a concomitant protection against a decrease in GSK3β-Ser(9) phosphorylation. Here, we developed an in vitro model to investigate this protective effect of VPA and define a molecular mechanism. Experimental approach: The human hepatocarcinoma cell line (Huh7) was exposed to conditions occurring during haemorrhagic shock (hypoxia, hypercapnia and hypothermia) to investigate the changes in GSK3β-Ser(9) phosphorylation for a 4 h period following treatment with VPA, related congeners, PPAR agonists, antagonists and siRNA. Key results: Huh7 cells undergoing combined hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypothermia reproduced the reduced GSK3β-Ser(9) phosphorylation shown in vivo during haemorrhagic shock, and this change was blocked by VPA. The protective effect occurred through upstream PTEN and Akt signalling, and prevented downstream β-catenin degradation while increasing histone 2/3 acetylation. This effect was reproduced by several VPA-related compounds with known PPARγ agonist activity, independent of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity. Specific pharmacological inhibition (by T0070907) or knockdown of PPARγ blocked the protective effect of VPA against these signalling changes and apoptosis. In addition, specific activation of PPARγ using ciglitazone reproduced the changes induced by VPA in haemorrhagic shock-like conditions. Conclusion and implications: Changes in GSK3β-Ser(9) phosphorylation in in vivo haemorrhagic shock models can be modelled in vitro, and this has identified a role for PPARγ activation in the protective role of VPA.",

    "Abstract": "Sorafenib improves outcomes in adult hepatocellular carcinoma; however, hand foot skin reaction (HFSR) is a dose limiting toxicity of sorafenib that limits its use. HFSR has been associated with sorafenib systemic exposure. The objective of this study was to use modeling and simulation to determine whether using pharmacokinetically guided dosing to achieve a predefined sorafenib target range could reduce the rate of HFSR. Sorafenib steady-state exposures (area under the concentration curve from 0 to 12-h [AUC0->12 h ]) were simulated using published sorafenib pharmacokinetics at either a fixed dosage (90 mg/m2 /dose) or a pharmacokinetically guided dose targeting an AUC0->12 h between 20 and 55 h µg/ml. Dosages were either rounded to the nearest quarter of a tablet (50 mg) or capsule (10 mg). A Cox proportional hazard model from a previously published study was used to quantify HFSR toxicity. Simulations showed that in-target studies increased from 50% using fixed doses with tablets to 74% using pharmacokinetically guided dosing with capsules. The power to observe at least 4 of 6 patients in the target range increased from 33% using fixed dosing with tablets to 80% using pharmacokinetically guided with capsules. The expected HFSR toxicity rate decreased from 22% using fixed doses with tablets to 16% using pharmacokinetically guided dosing with capsules. The power to observe less than 6 of 24 studies with HFSR toxicity increased from 51% using fixed dosing with tablets to 88% using pharmacokinetically guided with capsules. Our simulations provide the rationale to use pharmacokinetically guided sorafenib dosing to maintain effective exposures that potentially improve tolerability in pediatric clinical trials.",

    "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Although it has become one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the Western world, the proportion of NAFLD patients developing these complications is rather small. Therefore, current guidelines recommend noninvasive tests for the initial assessment of NAFLD. Among the available non-invasive tests, transient elastography by FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France) is commonly used by hepatologists in Europe and Asia, and the machine has been introduced to the United States in 2013 with rapid adoption. Transient elastography measures liver stiffness and the controlled attenuation parameter simultaneously and can serve as a one-stop examination for both liver steatosis and fibrosis. Liver stiffness measurement also correlates with clinical outcomes and can be used to select patients for varices screening. Although obesity is a common reason for measurement failures, the development of the XL probe allows successful measurements in the majority of obese patients. This article reviews the performance and limitations of transient elastography in NAFLD and highlights its clinical applications. We also discuss the reliability criteria for transient elastography examination and factors associated with false-positive liver stiffness measurements.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Despite improvements in techniques and management of liver transplant patients, numerous perioperative complications that contribute to perioperative mortality remain. Models to predict intraoperative massive blood transfusion, prolonged mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital mortality in liver transplant recipients have not been identified. In this study we aim to identify preoperative factors associated with the above mentioned complications. Methods: A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on data collected from 124 orthotopic liver transplants performed at a single institution between 2014 and 2017. A multivariable logistic regression using backwards elimination was performed for three defined outcomes (massive transfusion ≥ 10 units packed red blood cells (PRBC), prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h, and in-hospital mortality) to identify associations with preoperative characteristics. Results: Statistically significant (P < 0.05) associations with massive transfusion ≥ 10 units PRBC were hepatocellular carcinoma and preoperative transfusion of PRBC. Significant associations with prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h were hepatitis C, alcoholic hepatitis, elevated preoperative ALT, and hepatorenal syndrome. Male gender was protective for requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. End-stage renal disease and hepatitis B were significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: This study identified risk factors associated with common perioperative complications of liver transplantation. These factors may assist practitioners in risk stratification and may form the basis for further investigations of potential interventions to mitigate these risks.",

    "Abstract": "E-cadherin is a key cell adhesion protein implicated as a tumor/invasion suppressor in human carcinomas and a binding partner of beta-catenin, which plays a critical role in Wnt signaling and in tumorigenesis. Here we report genetic and expression studies of E-cadherin and beta-catenin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin expression in 37 HCCs and adjacent nontumor tissues revealed important variations among tumor samples, ranging from complete or heterogeneous down-regulation in 35% of cases to marked overexpression in 40% of tumors. Loss of E-cadherin expression was closely associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the E-cadherin locus and methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region (P <.002), predominantly in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related tumors (P <.005). No mutation of the E-cadherin gene could be detected in the tumors examined, suggesting the requirement for reversible mechanisms of E-cadherin down-regulation. In most HCCs, including E-cadherin-positive and -negative cases, beta-catenin was strongly expressed at the cell membrane and nuclear accumulation of the protein was correlated with the presence of mutations in the beta-catenin gene itself, but not with E-cadherin loss. At difference with a number of epithelial cancers, vascular invasion was frequently noted in HCCs showing enforced expression of the membranous E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex. In conclusion, these data support the notion that E-cadherin might play diverse and seemingly paradoxic roles in HCC, reflecting specific requirements for tumor growth and spread in the liver environment.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, how their interaction is involved in the prognostic value of HCC and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy remains unclear. Methods: The RNA sequencing and clinical data of HCC patients were collected from TCGA database. The prognostic m6A-related lncRNAs were screened out with Pearson correlation test, univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. Patients with HCC were classified into 2 subtypes by consensus clustering. Survival analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of different clusters and risk models. Potential tumor correlated biological pathways correlated with different clusters were explored through gene set enrichment analysis. We also identified the relationship of the risk model and clusters with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy and tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, the prognostic value of the 9 m6A-related lncRNAs was validated in the external cohort. Finally, the role of SNHG4 was explored by silencing and overexpression of SNHG4 through conducting proliferation, migration and invasion experiments. Results: Patients from 2 clusters and different risk groups based on m6A-related lncRNAs had significantly different clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival outcomes. Tumor-correlated biological pathways were found to be correlated with Cluster 2 through GSEA. Moreover, we found that patients from different clusters and risk groups expressed higher levels of immune checkpoint genes and had distinct TME and different responses for ICIs therapy. Prognostic value of this risk model was further confirmed in the external cohort. Finally, consistent with the discovery, SNHG4 played an oncogenic role in vitro. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the 9 m6A-related lncRNA signature may serve as a novel predictor in the prognosis of HCC and optimize (ICIs) therapy. SNHG4 plays an oncogenic role in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "There is mounting evidence that alterations of cell death processes are involved in cancer pathogenesis. ATG5 is a key regulator of autophagic and apoptotic cell death. The aim of this study was to see whether alterations of ATG5 protein expression and somatic mutation of ATG5 gene are features of human gastrointestinal cancers. In this study, we analyzed ATG5 somatic mutation in 45 gastric, 45 colorectal, and 45 hepatocellular carcinomas by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Also, we analyzed ATG5 protein expression in 100 gastric, as well as in 95 colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas using immunohistochemistry. Overall, we detected two somatic missense mutations of ATG5 gene in the coding sequences p.Leu112Phe and p.His41Tyr. The mutations were observed in one gastric and one hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, ATG5 protein was well expressed in normal stomach, colon, and liver epithelial cells, while it was lost in 21 (21%) of the gastric carcinomas, in 22 (23%) of the colorectal carcinomas, and in 5 (10%) of the hepatocellular carcinomas. Our data suggest that ATG5 gene could be altered in gastrointestinal cancers at the mutational or expressional level. Despite the low incidences of the alterations, our data led us to conclude that somatic mutation and loss of expression of ATG5 gene might play a role in gastrointestinal cancer pathogenesis by altering autophagic and apoptotic cell death.",

    "Abstract": "Background & aims: p53 Mutations are very common in human hepatocellular carcinoma, and induction of hepatic p53 expression causes lysis of implanted hepatoblastoma cells in a chimeric mouse. Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase senses DNA strand breaks and induces p53. Our aims were to establish whether ATM deficiency alters the carcinogenic response of hepatocytes to diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Methods: Male ATM-deficient (ATM(-/-)), heterozygote (ATM(+/-)), and wild-type (WT) mice were injected with DEN at age 15 days, and animals were killed up to 12 months to assess p53, cell cycle, apoptosis, and liver tumor development. Results: Whereas >80% of WT and ATM(+/-) mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), at 9-12 months, ATM(-/-) mice remained refractory to DEN-induced HCC up to 15 months. At 6 and 9 months, and compared with WT mice, p53 and p19(ARF) expression were greatly enhanced in ATM(-/-) liver associated with up-regulation of ATR and Chk1; cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and caspase-3 activity were also significantly increased. Whereas livers of DEN-treated ATM(-/-) mice showed markers of senescence (beta-galactosidase, Cxcl-1), up-regulation of telomerase occurred concurrently. The possibility that such balanced senescence could result in immortalization was demonstrated in hepatocytes prepared at 9 months from DEN-treated ATM(-/-) liver. Conclusions: Hepatocarcinogenesis is abrogated in ATM-deficient mice in association with induction of ATR, Chk1, p53, and p19(ARF). Resultant cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of DNA-damaged cells are possible mechanisms that underlie this unique \"refractoriness\" to malignant transformation in DEN-initiated ATM(-/-) hepatocytes. The findings also show that prolonged up-regulation of p53 associated with some features of senescence does not inevitably cause organ failure.",

    "Abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a key role in prompting the innate or immediate response. A growing body of evidence suggests that genetic variants of TLR4 gene were associated with the development of cancers. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of a functional variant (rs1057317) at microRNA-34a (miR-34a) binding site in toll-like receptor 4 gene and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. A single center-based case-control study was conducted. In this study, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing were used to genotype sequence variants of TLR4 in 426 hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 438 controls. The modification of rs1057317 on the binding of hsa-miR-34a to TLR4 messenger RNA (mRNA) was measured by luciferase activity assay. Individuals carrying the AA genotypes for the rs1057317 were associated significantly with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma comparing with those carrying wild-type homozygous CC genotypes (adjusted odds ratio [OR] by sex and age, from 1.116 to 2.452, P = 0.013). The activity of the reporter vector was lower in the reporter vector carrying C allele than the reporter vector carrying A allele. Furthermore, the expression of TLR4 was detected in the peripheral blood mononucleated cell of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, suggesting that mRNA and protein levels of TLR4 might be associated with SNP rs1057317. Collectively, these results suggested that the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with a functional variant at miR-34a binding site in toll-like receptor 4 gene. miR-34a/TLR4 axis may play an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "The Hepatitis B Virus X (HBx) protein of hepatitis B virus plays a major role in hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been reported that the mutation and disruption of PTEN, a known tumor suppressor and a negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT might be involved in tumor progression. However, the relationship between HBx and PTEN expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development is not fully understood. This study reports on an investigation of whether PTEN expression in HBx-transfected cells is modulated by HBx or not. HBx decreased the expression of PTEN in HBx-transfected cells, as evidenced by Western as well as Northern blot analysis. In addition, AKT was found to be activated by HBx, as evidenced by not only the phosphorylation of AKT at serine 473 but by the phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate histone H2B as well, and these were specifically blocked by the presence of wortmannin. Moreover, The growth rate of HBx-transfected liver cells was higher than that of Chang and Chang-pEGFP cells. HBx had no effect on the expression of p53, a known transcriptional activator of PTEN. However, we confirmed that the binding of the p53 protein to p53 binding site-oligo of PTEN promoter is decreased in HBx-transfected liver cells by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and, in addition, that HBx disrupts p53-mediated PTEN transcription, as evidenced by a PTEN promoter assay. Therefore, we conclude that HBx in liver cells down-regulates the expression of PTEN and activates AKT. This constitutes the first report to demonstrate that HBx has an effect on the p53-mediated transcription of PTEN, which, in turn, is associated with tumor suppression.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Experimental studies have suggested that end-ischaemic dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) may restore hepatocellular energy status and reduce reperfusion injury in donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver grafts. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to assess the safety and feasibility of DHOPE in DCD liver transplantation. Methods: In consecutive DCD liver transplantations, liver grafts were treated with end-ischaemic DHOPE. Outcome was compared with that in a control group of DCD liver transplantations without DHOPE, matched for donor age, donor warm ischaemia time, and recipient Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. All patients were followed for 1 year. Results: Ten transplantations involving liver grafts treated with DHOPE were compared with 20 control procedures. There were no technical problems. All 6-month and 1-year graft and patient survival rates were 100 per cent in the DHOPE group. Six-month graft survival and 1-year graft and patient survival rates in the control group were 80, 67 and 85 per cent respectively. During DHOPE, median (i.q.r.) hepatic adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) content increased 11-fold, from 6 (3-10) to 66 (42-87) µmol per g protein (P = 0·005). All DHOPE-preserved livers showed excellent early function. At 1 week after transplantation peak serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin levels were twofold lower in the DHOPE group than in the control group (ALT: median 966 versus 1858 units/l respectively, P = 0·006; bilirubin: median 1·0 (i.q.r. 0·7-1·4) versus 2·6 (0·9-5·1) mg/dl, P = 0·044). None of the ten DHOPE-preserved livers required retransplantation for non-anastomotic biliary stricture, compared with five of 20 in the control group (P = 0·140). Conclusion: This clinical study of end-ischaemic DHOPE in DCD liver transplantation suggests that the technique restores hepatic ATP, reduces reperfusion injury, and is safe and feasible. RCTs with larger numbers of patients are warranted to assess the efficacy in reducing post-transplant biliary complications.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Our study was carried out to explore the relationship of PIK3CA rs17849071 and rs17849079 polymorphisms with the susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese Han population. Methods: 150 HCC patients and 152 healthy individuals were recruited in the case and control groups respectively. The genotypes of PIK3CA rs17849071 and rs17849079 polymorphisms were detected with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The linkage disequilibrium and haplotypes were analyzed with Haploview software. Differences in frequencies of genotypes, alleles, and haplotypes between the case and control groups were checked with χ(2) test. The controls were matched with the cases in age and gender. The relative risk of HCC was represented by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: Significant difference in frequencies of GG genotype and G allele in PIK3CA rs17849071 polymorphism existed between the two groups (P=0.040; P=0.028), indicating that rs17849071 was closely related to the increased risk of HCC (OR=2.919, 95% CI=1.007-8.460; OR=1.642, 95% CI=1.051-2.564). Furthermore, TT genotype also significantly increased the susceptibility to HCC (OR=3.438, 95% CI=1.050-11.250) and so was T allele (OR=1.521, 95% CI=1.052-2.199). The haplotype analysisshowed that G-T haplotypes were higher in cases than that of controls (P=0.030), which suggested that G-T might be a susceptible haplotype to HCC. Conclusions: The PIK3CA rs17849071 and rs17849079 polymorphisms may increase the risk of HCC either independently or synergistically.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small nonprotein-coding RNAs with posttranscriptional regulatory functions as tumour suppressors and oncogenes. Aberrant expression and structural alteration of miRNAs are thought to participate in tumourigenesis and cancer development. It has been suggested that the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) can alter miRNA processing, expression, and/or binding to target mRNA and represent another type of genetic variability that can contribute to the development of human cancers. Recent studies have indicated that the miR-196a-2 rs11614913 (C→T) polymorphism could alter mature miR-196a-2 expression and target mRNA binding. To determine the association of the miR-196a-2 rs11614913 polymorphism with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in a Turkish population, a hospital-based case-control study was designed consisting of 185 subjects with HCC and 185 cancer-free control subjects matched for age, gender, smoking and alcohol status. The genotype frequency of the miR-196a-2 rs11614913 polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Our data shows that the CC genotype of the miR-196a-2 rs11614913 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of HCC development in this Turkish population (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.30-4.50, P = 0.005). Furthermore, according to stratified analysis, a significant association was observed between the homozygote CC genotype and HCC risk in the subgroups of male gender (OR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.53-6.34, P = 0.002) and patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC (OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.33-6.22, P = 0.007). Because our results suggest for the first time that the miR-196a-2 rs11614913 polymorphism may be a genetic susceptibility factor for HCC (especially in the male gender and HBV-infected patients) in the Turkish population, further independent studies are required to validate our findings in a larger series, as well as in patients of different ethnic origins.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high morbidity and mortality. Many studies reported that mir-375 is frequently down-regulated in many cancers including esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and leukemias. Aim: Our aim was to study the expression of microRNA-375 and its target gene SMAD-7 polymorphisms (rs4939827) in CRC patients in comparison to control subjects and to correlate these results with clinical data of patients to elucidate their role in pathogenesis and early diagnosis of CRC. Material and methods: The present study was conducted on 122 subjects divided into 86 patients with CRC and 36 age- and sex-matched controls. The followings were done to all subjects: full history taking, full clinical examination, complete blood picture, serum (ALT, AST), serum albumin, CEA, TLC, PLT, and creatinine. Gene expression of miRNA-375 from serum was done by real-time PCR. Gene polymorphism SNPs of SMAD7 (rs4939827) was also done in DNA extracted from blood by real-time PCR. Results: As regards the polymorphism of SMAD7, we found that CC (wild) genotype has high percentage in controls compared to CRC cases (36.1% vs 15.1%). Meanwhile, the mutant and heterozygotes genotypes showed high percentage among cases compared to controls (33.7%, and 51.2% respectively) vs (22.2%, and 41.7% respectively) with no significant statistical analysis. There was a statistically significant high T-allelic frequency among cases and C-allelic frequency among controls. There was a statistically significant association between fold change in micro RNA (-375) and the susceptibility to CRC as there is down-regulation of the microRNA-375 in CRC group with fold change in 0.42±0.27. Conclusion: Micro RNA-375 and rs4939827 SNP in SMAD7 could be considered as potential markers for detecting and early diagnosing CRC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Periodontitis is an oral disease that is highly prevalent worldwide, with a prevalence of 30-50% of the population in developed countries, but only ~10% present with severe forms. It is also estimated that periodontitis results in worldwide productivity losses amounting to ~54 billion USD yearly. In addition to the damage it causes to oral health, periodontitis also affects other types of disease. Numerous studies have confirmed the association between periodontitis and systemic diseases, such as diabetes, respiratory disease, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence also indicated that periodontitis may participate in the progression of liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as affecting liver transplantation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are currently no reviews elaborating upon the possible links between periodontitis and liver diseases. Therefore, the current review summarizes the human trials and animal experiments that have been conducted to investigate the correlation between periodontitis and liver diseases. Furthermore, in the present review, certain mechanisms that have been postulated to be responsible for the role of periodontitis in liver diseases (such as bacteria, pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress) are considered. The aim of the review is to introduce the hypothesis that periodontitis may be important in the progression of liver disease, thus providing dentists and physicians with an improved understanding of this issue.",

    "Abstract": "Whereas the hallmark of wild-type p53 is its tumor suppressor activity, tumor-associated mutant p53 proteins can exert novel anti-apoptotic gain-of-function activities, which confer a selective advantage upon tumor cells harboring such mutations. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of mutant p53 gain-of-function in hepatocellular carcinoma with special emphasis on the interaction of mutant p53 gain-of-function proteins with the p53 family members p63 and p73. Mutant forms of p53, namely the hot-spot mutants p53R143A, p53R175D, p53R175H, p53R248W, and p53R273H, acquire anti-apoptotic gain-of-function in hepatocellular carcinoma by repressing the activity of genes regulating both, the extrinsic apoptosis pathway initiated by ligation of death receptors and the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In the presence of mutated p53, the CD95L-CD95 apoptotic pathway is markedly attenuated. This is due to repression of CD95 gene transcription by mutant p53. In addition, these mutants repress the expression of the Bax gene and attenuate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis signaling. Furthermore, and of clinical relevance, these gain-of-function mutants are anti-apoptotic due to their inhibitory interaction with the pro-apoptotic p53 family members TAp63 and TAp73. p53 gain-of-function mutants significantly decrease activation of pro-apoptotic target genes by wild-type p53, TAp63, and TAp73. This contributes to the ability of cancer cells to withstand DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Interference with the interaction of p53 gain-of-function mutants with TAp63 or TAp73 may thus sensitize hepatocellular carcinoma to elimination by therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Acute liver injury has been attributed to dietary supplements (DS) used for weight loss, but their causal role was much questioned, and obesity as an alternative cause of the liver injury remained unclear. A comprehensive search of the Medline database was conducted with terms that included \"DS,\" \"liver injury,\" \"obesity,\" \"obesity-related liver diseases,\" and \"nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\" For each term, we focused on the first 50 publications. We undertook a manual search to identify additional reports. Underlying liver diseases and other health issues are common in patients taking DS for weight reduction. These include obesity or morbid obesity, as well as complex metabolic disorders complicated by excess morbidity and mortality due to associated liver diseases. Among these are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with potential progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, often classified as cryptogenic with a rare risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. With the exception of hepatocellular carcinoma, these obesity-related liver diseases were observed to varying degrees in patients, and some even required a liver transplant. This raises the question whether the liver injury that occurred in these patients is due to DS consumed for weight loss or to the underlying obesity-related liver diseases. This analysis showed that, in many instances, the causal role of obesity has been neglected. Obesity-associated liver diseases should be considered as differential diagnosis of liver injury in obese patients using DS.",

    "Abstract": "Previously, we reported the identification of a novel immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule hepaCAM that is frequently downregulated and inhibits cell growth in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we show that the expression of hepaCAM is suppressed in diverse human cancers. Aiming to evaluate the biological role of hepaCAM in breast cancer, we stably transfected the MCF7 cell line with either wild-type hepaCAM or its mutant hCAM-tailless that lacked the cytoplasmic domain. We found that hepaCAM inhibited colony formation and cell proliferation and arrested cells in the G(2)/M phase. Intriguingly, hepaCAM was capable of inducing cellular senescence as defined by the enlarged cell morphology and increased beta-galactosidase activity. Furthermore, hepaCAM elevated the expression levels of senescence-associated proteins including p53, p21 and p27. In contrast, cell growth inhibition and senescence were less apparent in cells overexpressing hCAM-tailless mutant. To determine if the p53-mediated pathway was involved in hepaCAM-induced senescence, we used the small-interfering RNA system to knock down endogenous p53 expression. In the presence of hepaCAM, downregulation of p53 resulted in a clear reduction of p21, insignificant change in p27 and alleviated senescence. Together, the results suggest that the expression of hepaCAM in MCF7 cells not only inhibits cell growth but also induces cellular senescence through the p53/21 pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this prospective study was to examine the diagnostic value of dual-energy CT (DECT) in the assessment of response of HCC after radioembolisation (RE). Material and methods: 40 HCC patients with 82 measurable target lesions were included in this study. At baseline and follow-up examination target lesions were evaluated with (IU), AASLD and Choi measurement criteria. Disease control was defined as the sum of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progression disease (PD) and stable disease (SD). Results: With Choi and IU more patients were considered than PR and less than PD and SD. According to AASLD more patients were measured as SD and PD than PR. 26/40 patients were classified as PR with IU. In contrast measurements with AASLD in only 8/26 patients were also classified as PR. 6/12 SD patients measured with IU were measured as PD with AASLD. 4/26 patients classified with IU as PR were described as SD with CHOI, 10/14 SD patients measured with CHOI were SD according to IU, the other 4 patients were PR with IU. 2/4 PD patients according to CHOI were SD with IU. Conclusion: More patients by IU were classified as SD versus PD and PR versus SD. We attribute this to the more detailed consideration of the HU differences between the virtual native and contrast-enhanced series generated by DECT. Iodine uptake (IU) in HCC measured and visualized with DECT is a promising imaging method for the assessment of treatment response after radioembolisations. Key points: -dual energy CT of hypervascular tumors such as HCC allows to quantify contrast enhancement without native imaging. -this can be used to evaluate the therapy response after Radioembolization.",

In addition, we found a single base replacement of G to A at nucleotide position of 67 (4 base upstream to the initial codon) in the mutant allele. Since the G67A substitution in the AT gene was very rare, this family was the second case, in which the nucleotide change was transmitted. To elucidate the mechanism of AT deficiency, we transiently expressed wild type and the mutant AT (DeltaM103) in HuH-7 human hepatoma cells and performed pulse-chase studies. The experiments revealed that the mutant AT (DeltaM103) hardly secreted into the medium and underwent partial intracellular degradation. In addition, we performed luciferase reporter assay to examine the effect of G67A substitution on the AT gene expression, and found that the substitution did not reduce the luciferase activity. These results suggested that secretion defect and intracellular degradation of the variant molecule with the deletion of Met 103 were responsible for AT deficiency in this family.",

There are conflicting opinions regarding the effects of entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) on HCC prevention. We assessed these two antiviral medications for preventing HCC in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using nationwide claims data from the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. We included 55,473 treatment-naïve adult cases where ETV or TDF treatment was started between 2013 and 2017 (cohort 1). The ETV and TDF groups were matched 1:2 based on age, sex, comorbidities, hospital type, and index date year. Patients were followed up until December 2018. The outcome was the development of HCC. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to sex, age, hospital type and the presence of cirrhosis. We also compared the outcomes of patients who had started antiviral therapy during the 2012-2014 period (cohort 2). Results: The matched participants (18,491 in the ETV and 36,982 in the TDF groups) were a part of the study for, on average, 41.2 months. The incidence of HCC did not differ significantly between the ETV (1.46 per 100 patient-years) and the TDF (1.36 per 100 patient-years) treatments (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.01; P = 0.081). By contrast, HCC incidence was significantly higher in the ETV group than tenofovir group of cohort 2. Conclusion: In patients with chronic hepatitis B, the ETV treatment did not result in a higher rate of HCC than the TDF treatment.",

Results: Between November 2018 and December 2020, 62 uHCC patients who underwent triple therapy at four major cancer centers in China were analyzed, including 35 in BCLC-C, 21 in BCLC-B, and 6 in BCLC-A. With a median follow-up of 12.2 months (range, 7.6-33.3 months), the investigator and blinded independent central review-assessed ORR were 80.6% and 77.4%, respectively. A total of 33 patients (53.2%) reached the standard of conversion to resectable HCC and 29 patients underwent resection. The median interval between start of triple therapy and resection was 123 days (range, 55-372 days). Pathological complete response and major pathological response were observed in 16 and 24 patients, respectively. Median overall survival and progression-free survival were not reached. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 74.2% of the patients (grade ≥3, 14.5%; grade ≥4, 4.8%). Conclusion: Combination of LEN, PD-1 and TACE showed a high rate of tumor response and convert resection in uHCC patients, with manageable toxicity.",

    "Abstract": "This prospective cohort study aimed to elucidate the clinical outcome and its related factors of chronic hepatitis C in a hepatitis B-dominant Asian region.From January 2007 to October 2012, 382 patients with chronic hepatitis C without liver cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled at 6 university hospitals, and regularly followed until Apr 2014 to identify the development of liver cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and overall survival.During the median follow-up of 39.0 months (range 18.0-81.0 months), liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC developed in 42 patients (11.0%), 4 patients (1.0%), and 12 patients (3.1%), respectively. The cumulative probability of development of cirrhosis at 3 years and at 5 years was 9.6% and 16.7%, respectively. That of HCC at 3 and 5 years was 1.6% and 4.5%, respectively. The 3-year and 5-year overall survival rate was 99.7% and 96.0%, respectively. Pegylated interferon-based antiviral therapy was undertaken in 237 patients (62.0%) with a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of 74.3%. The factors related to the overall clinical outcomes were age ≥55 years (HR 2.924, P = 0.016), platelet counts <150 × 10/L (HR 3.195, P = 0.007), and the achievement of SVR (HR 0.254, P = 0.002).The clinical outcomes of this Korean chronic hepatitis C cohort were modest with minimal mortality, but significant disease progression occurred in the patients with old age, low platelet, and non-SVR after interferon-based antiviral treatment or no treatment, suggesting priority for direct acting antiviral therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Effective prophylactic therapies have not been established for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence. Peretinoin represents one novel option for patients with hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCV-HCC), and it was tested in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Methods: Patients with curative therapy were assigned to one of the following regimens: peretinoin 600, 300 mg/day, or placebo for up to 96 weeks. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results: Of the 401 patients initially enrolled, 377 patients were analyzed for efficacy. The RFS rates in the 600-mg group, the 300-mg group, and the placebo group were 71.9, 63.6, and 66.0 % at 1 year, and 43.7, 24.9, and 29.3 % at 3 years, respectively. The primary comparison of peretinoin (300 and 600-mg) with placebo was not significant (P = 0.434). The dose-response relationship based on the hypothesis that \"efficacy begins to increase at 600 mg/day\" was significant (P = 0.023, multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.048). The hazard ratios for RFS in the 600-mg group vs. the placebo group were 0.73 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.03] for the entire study period and 0.27 (95 % CI 0.07-0.96) after 2 years of the randomization. Common adverse events included ascites, increased blood pressure, headache, presence of urine albumin, and increased transaminases. Conclusions: Although the superiority of peretinoin to placebo could not be validated, 600 mg/day was shown to be the optimal dose, and treatment may possibly reduce the recurrence of HCV-HCC, particularly after 2 years. The efficacy and safety of peretinoin 600 mg/day should continue to be evaluated in further studies.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Inflammation factors affect the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it is not clear if the preoperative neutrophil lymphocyte ratio to albumin ratio (NLRAR) and white blood cell to hemoglobin ratio (WHR) affect the prognosis of HCC post curative hepatectomy. We assessed the prognostic values of NLRAR and WHR in patients suffering from HCC who underwent curative resection. Materials and methods: A total of 169 eligible HCC cases were reviewed. The optimal cut-off values for NLRAR and WHR were selected using the X-tile software. The overall survival (OS) rate was assessed following the Kaplan-Meier analysis method. The Log rank test and Cox proportional hazard regression model were also used to analyze the data. The prognostic values of NLRAR and WHR were calculated by analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed for clinical benefits. Results: The OS rate recorded for the high NLRAR group was poorer than the OS rate recorded for the low NLRAR group. Similar trends were observed for WHR. The NLRAR and WHR were the independent predictors of OS. The results were based on the multivariate Cox analyses method. Results obtained by analyzing the subgroups revealed that NLRAR and WHR could be used for the prognosis of HCC in tumor stage I-patients. The NLRAR-WHR scoring system (NWS) could be used to classify HCC patients into two cohorts with different prognoses. This scoring system was more efficient than NLRAR or WHR in predicting OS. Conclusion: The preoperative NLRAR and WHR are effective prognostic indicators for HCC in patients who underwent curative hepatectomy.",

    "Abstract": "Approximately 5% of individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are coinfected with hepatitis D virus (HDV). Chronic HBV/HDV coinfection is associated with an unfavourable outcome, with many patients developing liver cirrhosis, liver failure and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma within 5-10 years. The identification of the HBV/HDV receptor and the development of novel in vitro and animal infection models allowed a more detailed study of the HDV life cycle in recent years, facilitating the development of specific antiviral drugs. The characterisation of HDV-specific CD4+ and CD8+T cell epitopes in untreated and treated patients also permitted a more precise understanding of HDV immunobiology and possibly paves the way for immunotherapeutic strategies to support upcoming specific therapies targeting viral or host factors. Pegylated interferon-α has been used for treating HDV patients for the last 30 years with only limited sustained responses. Here we describe novel treatment options with regard to their mode of action and their clinical effectiveness. Of those, the entry-inhibitor bulevirtide (formerly known as myrcludex B) received conditional marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) in 2020 (Hepcludex). One additional drug, the prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib, is currently under investigation in phase III clinical trials. Other treatment strategies aim at targeting hepatitis B surface antigen, including the nucleic acid polymer REP2139Ca. These recent advances in HDV virology, immunology and treatment are important steps to make HDV a less difficult-to-treat virus and will be discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver malignancy. From the results of previous studies, Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has shown satisfactory diagnostic value. However, a unified conclusion on the interobserver stability of this innovative ultrasound imaging has not been determined. The present meta-analysis examined the interobserver agreement of CEUS LI-RADS to provide some reference for subsequent related research. Aim: To evaluate the interobserver agreement of LI-RADS on CEUS and analyze the sources of heterogeneity between studies. Methods: Relevant papers on the subject of interobserver agreement on CEUS LI-RADS published before March 1, 2020 in China and other countries were analyzed. The studies were filtered, and the diagnostic criteria were evaluated. The selected references were analyzed using the \"meta\" and \"metafor\" packages of R software version 3.6.2. Results: Eight studies were ultimately included in the present analysis. Meta-analysis results revealed that the summary Kappa value of included studies was 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.83], which shows substantial agreement. Higgins I 2 statistics also confirmed the substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 91.30%, 95% confidence interval, 85.3%-94.9%, P < 0.01). Meta-regression identified the variables, including the method of patient enrollment, method of consistency testing, and patient race, which explained the substantial study heterogeneity. Conclusion: CEUS LI-RADS demonstrated overall substantial interobserver agreement, but heterogeneous results between studies were also obvious. Further clinical investigations should consider a modified recommendation about the experimental design.",

Previous studies and neurotherapeutic clinical trials have assessed the molecular mechanisms that underlie neuronal cell death following CNS injury. However, this approach has largely failed to reduce CNS damage or improve the functional recovery of patients. Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular (Eph) receptors and ephrin ligands have attracted considerable attention since their discovery, due to their extensive distribution and unique bidirectional signaling between astrocytes and neurons. Previous studies have investigated the roles of Eph/ephrin bidirectional signaling in the developing central nervous system. It was determined that Eph/ephrin bidirectional signaling is expressed in various CNS regions and cell types, and that it serves diverse roles in the adult CNS. In the present review, the roles of Eph/ephrin bidirectional signaling in CNS injuries are assessed.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The United States Immunodeficiency Network (USIDNET) patient registry was used to characterize the presentation, genetics, phenotypes, and treatment of patients with Hyper IgM Syndrome (HIGM). Methods: The USIDNET Registry was queried for HIGM patient data collected from October 1992 to July 2015. Data fields included demographics, criteria for diagnosis, pedigree analysis, mutations, clinical features, treatment and transplant records, laboratory findings, and mortality. Results: Fifty-two physicians entered data from 145 patients of ages 2 months to 62 years (median 12 years); 131 were males. Using patients' age at last entry, data from 2072 patient years are included. Mutations were recorded for 85 subjects; 82 were in CD40LG. Eighteen subjects had non-X-linked HIGM. 40 % had a normal serum IgM and 15 %, normal IgA. Infections were reported for 91 %, with pulmonary, ear, and sinus infections being the most common. 42 % had Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; 6 % had Cryptosporidium. 41 % had neutropenia. 78 % experienced non-infectious complications: chronic diarrhea (n = 22), aphthous ulcers (n = 28), and neoplasms (n = 8) including colon cancer, adrenal adenoma, liver adenocarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoid, acute myeloid leukemia, hepatoma, and, in a female with an autosomal dominant gain of function mutation in PIK3CD, an ovarian dysgerminoma. Thirteen patients had a hematopoietic marrow or stem cell transplant; three had solid organ transplants. Thirteen were known to have died (median age = 14 years). Conclusions: Analysis of the USIDNET Registry provides data on the common clinical features of this rare syndrome, and in contrast with previously published data, demonstrates longer survival times and reduced gastrointestinal manifestations.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Long-term prognosis of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) remains incompletely characterized. We investigated the long-term prognosis of liver disease in patients with chronic HCV infection who have not received antiviral therapy. Methods: A total of 2304 patients with chronic HCV who were not received interferon-based therapy were included. Results: In the assessment of 1-year disease state of liver transition probabilities, progression to chronic hepatitis occurred in 12% to 14% of patients across all age groups in male asymptomatic carriers. In male patients with chronic hepatitis, progression to cirrhosis was observed mostly in the 60 to 69 (7.6%) and ≥70 age groups (9.6%). In addition, in male patients with cirrhosis, HCC development occurred in approximately 5% of patients over the age of 40. In female asymptomatic carriers, progression to chronic hepatitis was observed in 6% to 14% of patients across all age groups. In female patients with chronic hepatitis, progression to cirrhosis was observed mostly in the 60 to 69 (8.7%) and ≥70 (7.4%) age groups. In addition, in female patients with cirrhosis, HCC development occurred in 0.9% to 3.3% of patients over the age of 50. Under assumptions of either chronic hepatitis or asymptomatic carrier state at age 40 as the starting condition for simulation over the following 40 years, the probability of HCC gradually increased with age and was higher in male patients. Conclusions: There is a risk of cirrhosis or HCC development in HCV patients with not only chronic hepatitis but the asymptomatic carrier state as well.",

    "Abstract": "In the United States, chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated 0.1-2% of the pediatric population, who are consequently at risk for major complications, including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The current standard of treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in children is pegylated-interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN) in combination with ribavirin. PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy is approved for children ages 3 and older; however, it is often held from use until adulthood because of its extensive list of potential side effects and high likelihood of causing adverse symptoms. While CHC is usually indolent in children and adolescents, immediately treating and curbing the spread of HCV before adulthood is important, as there can be transmission to other individuals via sexual activity and infected females can later vertically transmit the infection during pregnancy, the latter representing the most common means of transmission for children in the United States. The recent development of direct-acting antivirals has shown promising results in clinical trials for use in children and has dramatically increased the rates of sustained virological response in adults while improving side effect profiles as compared to interferon-based treatments. Given the usually indolent course of CHC in children, significant side effects of the currently-approved PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy, and likely availability of all-oral interferon-free regimens for children within a few years, deferring treatment in clinically-stable children with CHC in anticipation of upcoming superior treatment modalities may be justified.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cirrhosis is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Portal vein thrombosis is not uncommon after splenectomy in cirrhotic patients, and many such patients take oral anticoagulants including aspirin. However, the long-term impact of postoperative aspirin on cirrhotic patients after splenectomy remains unknown. Aim: The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of postoperative long-term low-dose aspirin administration on the development of HCC and long-term survival of cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. Methods: The clinical data of 264 adult patients with viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis who underwent splenectomy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 2000 to December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. Among these patients, 59 who started taking 100 mg/d aspirin within seven days were enrolled in the aspirin group. The incidence of HCC and overall survival were analyzed. Results: During follow-up, 41 (15.53%) patients developed HCC and 37 (14.02%) died due to end-stage liver diseases or other serious complications. Postoperative long-term low-dose aspirin therapy reduced the incidence of HCC from 19.02% to 3.40% after splenectomy (log-rank test, P = 0.028). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that not undertaking postoperative long-term low-dose aspirin therapy [odds ratio (OR) = 6.211, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.142-27.324, P = 0.016] was the only independent risk factor for the development of HCC. Similarly, patients in the aspirin group survived longer than those in the control group (log-rank test, P = 0.041). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the only factor that independently associated with improved overall survival was postoperative long-term low-dose aspirin therapy [OR = 0.218, 95%CI: 0.049-0.960, P = 0.044]. Conclusion: In patients with viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis, long-term post-splenectomy administration of low-dose aspirin reduces the incidence of HCC and improves the long-term overall survival.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To characterize isolated non-obstructive sinusoidal dilatation (SD) by identifying associated conditions, laboratory findings, and histological patterns. Methods: Retrospectively reviewed 491 patients with SD between 1995 and 2015. Patients with obstruction at the level of the small/large hepatic veins, portal veins, or right-sided heart failure were excluded along with history of cirrhosis, hepatic malignancy, liver transplant, or absence of electrocardiogram/cardiac echocardiogram. Liver histology was reviewed for extent of SD, fibrosis, red blood cell extravasation, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, hepatic peliosis, and hepatocellular plate atrophy (HPA). Results: We identified 88 patients with non-obstructive SD. Inflammatory conditions (32%) were the most common cause. The most common pattern of liver abnormalities was cholestatic (76%). Majority (78%) had localized SD to Zone III. Medication-related SD had higher proportion of portal hypertension (53%), ascites (58%), and median AST (113 U/L) and ALT (90 U/L) levels. Nineteen patients in our study died within one-year after diagnosis of SD, majority from complications related to underlying diseases. Conclusion: Significant proportion of SD and HPA exist without impaired hepatic venous outflow. Isolated SD on liver biopsy, in the absence of congestive hepatopathy, requires further evaluation and portal hypertension should be rule out.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Sorafenib is the first-line treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its clinical response rate is only about 10%. In clinical practice, some HCC patients obtain favorable overall survival (OS) to the treatment of sorafenib while some patients do not demonstrate a sensitive response to sorafenib. Therefore, it is valuable to determine the subgroups of patients who respond well as well as poorly to sorafenib. Thus, clinical variables of advanced HCC patients with sorafenib treatment were compiled to investigate whether monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) could be a biomarker for predicting sorafenib response. Patients and methods: In this study, a total of 142 patients with advanced HCC were enrolled from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016 at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. MLR was analyzed using a ROC curve. A Cox regression model and log-rank test were performed to analyze the relationship between clinical factors and OS, as well as progression free survival (PFS). Results: The optimal cut-off point for MLR was 0.35, and MLR level had no significant correlation with age, gender, hepatitis B infection, grade, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and state of portal vein tumor thrombus. Multivariate Cox regression model showed that grade (HR: 0.608, 95% CI: 0.409-0.904, P=0.014), AFP (HR: 0.445, 95% CI: 0.307-0.645, P=0.0001), MLR (HR: 0.445, 95% CI: 0.301-0.658, P=0.0001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (HR: 1.005, 95% CI: 1.001-1.009, P=0.007) may serve as independent prognostic predictors for OS, and MLR maintained significant correlation with PFS in HCC patients (HR: 0.457, 95% CI: 0.308-0.678, P=0.0001). By log-rank test, there was longer PFS and OS in patients with low MLR than in those with high MLR (both P=0.0001). Conclusion: MLR can predict sorafenib response and a high MLR is correlated with poor prognosis in patients with advanced HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of worldwide mortality. Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 (Y90), a transcatheter intra-arterial procedure performed by interventional radiology, has become widely utilized in managing HCC. Methods: The following is a focused review of TARE covering its commercially available products, clinical considerations of treatment, salient clinical trial data establishing its utility, and the current and future roles of TARE in the management of HCC. Results: TARE is indicated for patients with unresectable, intermediate stage HCC. The two available products are glass and resin microspheres. All patients undergoing TARE must be assessed with a history, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, imaging, and arteriography with macroaggregated albumin. TARE is safe and effective in the treatment of unresectable HCC, as it has a safer toxicity profile than chemoembolization, longer time-to-progression, greater ability to downsize and/or bridge patients to liver transplant, and utility in tumor complicated by portal vein thrombosis. TARE can also serve as an alternative to ablation and chemotherapy. Conclusion: TARE assumes an integral role in the management of unresectable HCC and has been validated by numerous studies.",

    "Abstract": "Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple susceptible variants associated with persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, most of these variants are located in the noncoding regions, which make it difficult to determine the effective genes underlying these associations. We performed a two-stage study, in the first stage we integrated RNA sequencing data of liver tissues and high-density genotyping data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project with our previous GWAS data to conduct a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) on HBV infection. Firstly, the cis-heritable genes were screened by a genetic relatedness matrix of genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) from GTEx data. Then, the genetic expression of 2587 cis-heritable genes was predicted by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) of genome-wide efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA) in our GWAS data with 951 HBV carrier cases and 937 HBV cleared controls. Next, we investigated the associations between predictive expression levels and persistent HBV infection risk. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to infer the function of the identified genes. To identify the causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HBV infection risk, we conducted the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)-based stepwise logistic regression analysis in the regions around 1 Mb of these genes and validated the association between 994 health controls and 994 HBV-persistent infection cases by genotyping experiment. In the second stage, 1538 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases and 1465 persistent HBV infection controls were collected to determine the effect of these variants on HBV-related HCC as well, which were examined by the additive model in logistic regression analysis. We identified seven genes associated with HBV infection. In the classic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, three novel genes BAK1, HLA-DOB and C4A (Z range from -3.95 to -3.64, P range from 7.84 × 10-5 to 2.00 × 10-4 ), as well as two genes (HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1) were reported by previous GWAS. In the non-HLA region, immune related at newly identified loci, PARP9 (Z = 3.69, P = 2.20 × 10-4 ) at 3q21.1. At 22q11.21, we identified TMEM191A (Z = 3.55, P = 3.80 × 10-4 ) as a target gene in addition to the reported non-cis-heritable gene UBE2L3. After further stepwise logistic regression analysis and validation, we identified eight variants independently associated with persistent HBV infection. Among those variants, the additive model showed that two SNPs associated with HBV-related HCC risk (rs9272714 and rs9394194, OR range from 1.20 to 1.25, P range from 1.19 × 10-4 to 3.97 × 10-4 ). By integrating transcriptome data, our study not only identified new susceptibility loci of persistent HBV infection but also determined the potential target genes at reported loci, which provided insight into the genetic aetiology of persistent HBV infection and related HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Accumulating studies have investigated the prognostic and clinical significance of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the results were conflicting and inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to combine controversial data to precisely evaluate this issue. Methods: Relevant studies were thoroughly searched on PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase until April 2016. Eligible studies were evaluated by selection criteria. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate the prognostic role of PD-L1 for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)/recurrence-free survival (RFS). Odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI were selected to assess the relationship between PD-L1 and clinicopathological features of HCC patients. Publication bias was tested using Begg's funnel plot. Results: A total of seven studies published from 2009 to 2016 were included for meta-analysis. The data showed that high PD-L1 expression was correlated to shorter OS (HR =2.09, 95% CI: 1.66-2.64, P<0.001) as well as poor DFS/RFS (HR =2.3, 95% CI: 1.46-3.62, P<0.001). In addition, increased PD-L1 expression was also associated with tumor differentiation (HR =1.51, 95% CI: 1-2.29, P=0.05), vascular invasion (HR =2.16, 95% CI: 1.43-3.27, P<0.001), and α-fetoprotein (AFP; HR =1.46, 95% CI: 1-2.14, P=0.05), but had no association with tumor stage, tumor size, hepatitis history, sex, age, or tumor multiplicity. No publication bias was found for all analyses. Conclusion: This meta-analysis revealed that overexpression of PD-L1 was predictive for shortened OS and DFS/RFS in HCC. Furthermore, increased PD-L1 expression was associated with less differentiation, vascular invasion, and AFP elevation.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To identify the characteristics and initial disease severity of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and assess incidence and risk factors for disease progression in a retrospective study. Methods: Patients ≥18 years of age without alcoholism or other liver diseases (eg, hepatitis B/C) were selected from Geisinger Health System electronic medical record data from 2004 to 2015. Initial disease stage was stratified into uncomplicated NAFLD, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver transplant using clinical biomarkers, diagnosis, and procedure codes. Disease progression was defined as stage progression or death and analyzed via Kaplan-Meier plots and multistate models. Results: In the NAFLD cohort (N=18,754), 61.5% were women, 39.0% had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the mean body mass index was 38.2±10.2 kg/m2. At index, 69.9% had uncomplicated NAFLD, 11.7% had advanced fibrosis, and 17.8% had cirrhosis. Of 18,718 patients assessed for progression, 17.3% progressed (11.0% had stage progression, 6.3% died without evidence of stage progression) during follow-up (median=842 days). Among subgroups, 12.3% of those without diabetes mellitus progressed vs 24.7% of those with T2DM. One-year mortality increased from 0.5% in uncomplicated NAFLD to 22.7% in HCC. After liver transplant, mortality decreased to 5.6% per year. Conclusions: In 2.3 years of follow-up, approximately 17% of patients progressed or died without evidence of stage progression. T2DM was associated with approximately twice the risk of disease progression, and mortality risk increased with disease stage. Early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression, especially in patients with T2DM, is warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Hereditary congenital cataract (HCC) is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. We investigated HCC that segregates in three inbred families (LUCC03, LUCC16, and LUCC24). Ophthalmological examinations revealed cataracts with variability related to the age of onset segregating in a recessive manner in these families. Exome sequencing of probands identified a novel homozygous c.2710delG;p.(Val904Cysfs*36) EPHA2 variant in LUCC03 and a known homozygous c.2353G>A;p.(Ala785Thr) EPHA2 variant in the other two recessive families. EPHA2 encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, which is primarily involved in membrane-transport, cell-cell adhesion, and repulsion signaling processes. Computational structural modeling predicts that substitution of a threonine for an alanine p.(Ala785Thr) results in the formation of three new hydrogen bonds with the neighboring residues, which causes misfolding of EPHA2 in both scenarios. Insights from our study will facilitate counseling regarding the molecular and phenotypic landscape of EPHA2-related HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic, progressive disease, that can advance to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite being a leading cause of liver transplantation, there are no approved pharmacological treatments. Our aim was to identify literature on management options in NASH. Our structured review of interventions treating NASH patients from English language publications between 1 January 2007 and 25 September 2017 elicited 48 eligible references. Lifestyle management was identified as the mainstay of NASH therapy. Vitamin E and pioglitazone reported reductions in steatosis; however, although recommended for some, no therapies are indicated in NASH. Multiple investigational treatments reported efficacy in mild-to-moderate fibrosis in Phase II/III NASH trials. Lifestyle management, although the focus of clinical guidelines, is insufficient for patients progressing to advanced fibrosis. With no clear guidelines for patients requiring interventions beyond lifestyle modification, long-term outcomes data are needed, particularly in patients with moderate-to-severe fibrosis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between patients with preoperative cholangitis and noncholangitis patients to determine whether the preoperative cholangitis would be able to serve as an independent predictive factor on hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCC) outcomes. Methods: A systematic literature search for reported preoperative cholangitis in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma was performed in 4 databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, published from 1979 to 2017. Results: In total, the initial search identified 1228 articles. Of these studies only 9 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this analysis. Differences between preoperative cholangitis existing and noncholangitis patients were observed in terms of mortality (RR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.48-3.52; P = .0002), overall morbidity (RR = 1.15;95% CI = 1.00-1.32; P = .04), Liver failure (RR = 1.15;95% CI = 1.00-1.32; P = .04), Infection (RR = 1.52;95% CI = 1.16-2.00; P = .003), sepsis (RR = 2.40;95% CI = 1.25-4.5; P = .008). Conclusions: The results lend support to the notion that in hilar cholangiocarcinoma patients, the existence of preoperative cholangitis is statistically associated with the higher postoperative mortality and morbidity. Also that it increases the risk of liver failure and infection. therefore, it is very important to properly control the preoperative cholangitis before surgery.",

We performed this meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic databases. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. Results: A total of 16,358 cases and 19,737 controls from 46 studies were included. Overall, significant association between CTLA-4 +49A/G polymorphism and cancer risk was observed in all genetic models (G vs. A: OR=0.88, 95%CI=0.83-0.93, PH=0.000; GA vs. AA: OR=0.87, 95%CI=0.79-0.97, PH=0.000; GG vs. AA: OR=0.75, 95%CI= 0.65-0.86, PH=0.000; GG vs. GA+AA: OR=0.84, 95%CI=0.79-0.91, PH=0.001; GG+GA vs. AA: OR=0.83, 95%CI=0.74-0.92, PH=0.000). Stratified analysis by cancer type revealed that the CTLA-4+49A/G polymorphism is associated with the decreased risk of cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, HCC. Further subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that there was a statistically decreased cancer risk in Asian population. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that CTLA-4+49A/G polymorphism is associated with cancer risk, especially in Asian population.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Previous epidemiological studies have suggested a potential role of the HSPA1B±1267A/G polymorphism in risk of developing cancer. However, the results were inconsistent. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to summarize the possible association with cancer risk. Materials and methods: We retrieved relevant articles from PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. Studies were selected using specific criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess those associations. All analyses were performed using STATA software. Results: Fourteen case-control studies, including 1, 834 cancer cases and 2, 028 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the results indicated that the G allele of HSPA1B gene ±1267A/G was significantly associated with an increased cancer risk in all genetic models (G vs A: OR=1.51, 95%CI 1.17-1.95, p=0.001; GG vs AA: OR=2.93, 95%CI 1.50-5.74, p=0.002; AG vs AA: OR=1.48, 95%CI 1.10-1.98, p=0.009; GG/AG vs AA: OR=1.69, 95%CI 1.22-2.33, p=0.001; GG vs Ag/aa: OR=2.31, 95%CI 1.24-4.32, p=0.009). In the subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity, a significant association was identified in Caucasians (G vs A: OR=1.35, 95%CI 1.08-1.69, p=0.008; GG/AG vs AA: OR=1.36, 95%CI 1.09-1.70, p=0.007), but not in Asians. In the stratified analysis by cancer types, individuals with the G allele showed an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma compared with carriers of the A allele (OR=2.40, 95%CI 1.47-3.91, p< 0.001). Inversely, individuals with the GG genotype showed a decreased risk of gastric cancer compared with carriers of the AG/GG genotypes (GG vs Ag/aa: OR=0.39, 95%CI 0.20-0.70, p=0.007). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests associations between the HSPA1B ±1267A/G polymorphism and risk of cancer. However, this association might be Caucasian-specific and the G allele of this polymorphism probably increases risk of hepatocellular carcinoma while decreasing risk of gastric cancer. Further well-designed studies based on larger sample sizes are needed to validate these findings.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The association between epidermal growth factor (EGF) gene +61A/G polymorphism (rs4444903) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility has been widely reported, but the results were inconsistent. To clarify the effect of this polymorphism on HCC risk, a meta-analysis was performed. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese BioMedical Literature (CBM), Wanfang and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies published up to December 2013. Data were extracted independently by two authors. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of association. Results: A total of 16 studies including 2475 HCC cases and 5381 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, a significantly increased HCC risk was observed under all genetic models (G vs. A: OR = 1.383, P < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.174-1.629; GG vs. GA + AA: OR = 1.484, P < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.198-1.838; GG + GA vs. AA: OR = 1.530, P < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.217-1.924; GG vs. AA: OR = 1.958, P < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.433-2.675; GA vs. AA: OR = 1.215, P = 0.013, 95% CI: 1.041-1.418).

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) and conventional TACE (C-TACE) in treating hypovascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and methods: The medical records based on HCC patients who underwent TACE from January 2016 to June 2019 were reviewed in the study. The diagnosis of hypovascular HCC was conducted by two senior radiologists according to imaging. We evaluated the adverse events (AEs), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the study. Results: A total of 98 patients with hypovascular HCC were included in the study. 46 patients underwent DEB-TACE treatment, and 52 patients underwent C-TACE treatment. The PFS of DEB-TACE group and C-TACE group was 12.0 months and 7.0 months (P < 0.001), and OS was 21.0 months and 14.0 months (P = 0.035), respectively. In addition, DEB-TACE group had better ORR (76.1% vs 40.4%, P < 0.001) and DCR (91.3% vs 75.0%, P = 0.033) compared to C-TACE group. The occurrence rate of AEs showed no difference between the two groups (67.3% vs 57.7%, P = 0.323). Furthermore, we found that DEB-TACE can be identified as a positive independent prognostic factor for improved PFS and OS. Conclusion: DEB-TACE, as an effective treatment, can yield better objective response rate, similar safety profile and improved survival for hypovascular HCC patients compared to C-TACE.",

    "Abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with metabolic syndrome, which includes diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. A fraction of NAFLD patients develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, leading to cirrhosis associated with various serious complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastroesophageal varices, cardiovascular events, and other organ malignancy. Although the incidence of chronic viral hepatitis with associated complications has gradually decreased as highly effective antiviral therapies have been established, the number of patients with steatohepatitis has been increasing.This retrospective study examined data of 229 patients from 22 hospitals in our region. We examined 155 cases of chronological data and assessed the development of liver fibrosis and evaluated hepatic reserve-related markers such as platelet count, FIB-4 index, prothrombin time, and serum albumin concentration. We analyzed the relationship of these chronological changes and the incidence of NAFLD related serious complications.Data related to liver fibrosis progression, albumin, and prothrombin time were significantly associated with the occurrence of serious complications associated with cirrhosis. We compared 22 event and 133 nonevent cases of chronological changes in the data per year and found that serum albumin concentration was significantly lower in the group that developed serious complications (event cases: -0.21 g/dL/year, nonevent cases: -0.04 g/dL/year (P < .001)). This albumin decline was only the associated factor with the event incidence by multivariate analysis (P < .01).Annual decline in serum albumin concentration in patients with NAFLD is associated with serious events from the outcome of multicenter retrospective study. This highlights its potential utility as a surrogate marker to assess the efficacy of prediction of NAFLD related serious events.",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the frequency and mechanism of beta-catenin/T cell factor (Tcf) signaling activation in a panel of 36 human gastrointestinal and liver cancer cell lines. Reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the beta-catenin/Tcf signaling was upregulated in 12 of 12 (100%) colorectal, 5 of 8 (68%) gastric, 2 of 7 (29%) hepatic, and none of 9 pancreatic cancer cell lines. The activation of the pathway was mainly due to the mutation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or beta-catenin, and Tcf-4 was highly expressed in these cell lines with upregulated signaling. Nuclear beta-catenin was observed not only in the signaling-activated cell lines, but also in 14 of 25 (56%) primary gastric cancers, 15 of 20 (75%) colon cancers, 5 of 19 (26%) hepatocellular carcinomas, and none of 13 pancreatic cancers. The presence of signaling-upregulated gastric cancer cell lines with intact APC and beta-catenin suggests the involvement of other mechanisms than mutations of APC or beta-catenin.",

    "Abstract": "Wnt signaling pathway is essential for development and tumorigenesis, however, this signaling pathway in the progress of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In this paper, we studied the function of human T-cell transcription factor-4 (TCF4), a key factor of Wnt signaling pathway, on the proliferation of HCC cell line. We showed that the expression of TCF4 mRNA in HCC cell line BEL-7402 was higher than that in immortalized normal liver cell line L02. Blockage of Wnt pathway by Delta-NTCF4, a dominant negative TCF4, could suppress BEL-7402 cells growth and decrease the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc, two of target genes of Wnt pathway. On the other hand, stimulating Wnt pathway by introducing a degradation-resistant -catenin S37A could increase BEL-7402 cells proliferation. But all the treatments had no effect on L02 cells. Our data indicated that TCF4 might be another key factor in Wnt pathway involved in HCC cells proliferation and TCF4 could be an effective therapeutic target for suppressing the growth of hepatocellular cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and its association with Tcf/Lef factors are key steps in transduction of the Wnt signal, which is aberrantly activated in a variety of human cancers. In a search for new beta-catenin-Tcf target genes, we analyzed beta-catenin-induced alterations of gene expression in primary human hepatocytes, after transduction of either dominant stable beta-catenin or its truncated, transactivation-deficient counterpart by means of a lentiviral vector. cDNA microarray analysis revealed a limited set of up-regulated genes, including known Wnt targets such as matrilysin and keratin-1. In this screen, we identified the CXC chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8) as a direct target of beta-catenin-Tcf4. IL-8 is constitutively expressed in various cancers, and it has been implicated in tumor progression through its mitogenic, motogenic, and angiogenic activities. The IL-8 promoter contains a unique consensus Tcf/Lef site that is critical for IL-8 activation by beta-catenin. We show here that the p300 coactivator was required for efficient transactivation of beta-catenin on this promoter. Ectopic expression of beta-catenin in hepatoma cells promoted IL-8 secretion, which stimulated endothelial cell migration. These data define IL-8 as a Wnt target and suggest that IL-8 induction by beta-catenin might be implicated in developmental and tumorigenic processes.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The goal of this study is to investigate the inappropriate activation of Wnt pathway in the hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods: We analyzed the alterations of three key components of Wnt pathway, beta-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) and T cell factor 4 (Tcf-4), in 34 samples of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and paracancerous normal liver by immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), direct sequencing, semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Results: We found 61.8% (21/34) of all the HCCs examined showed an abnormal beta-catenin protein accumulation in the cytoplasm or nuclei. RT-PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing showed that beta-catenin exon 3 mutations existed in 44.1% (15/34) of the HCCs. No mutations of GSK-3beta or Tcf-4 were detected in HCCs. Moreover, mRNA of beta-catenin and Tcf-4 but not GSK-3beta was found to be over expressed in HCCs. On analyzing the relationship between alterations of beta-catenin or Tcf-4 and C-myc or Cyclin D1 expression, we found that the mutations of beta-catenin as well as over expression of beta-catenin or Tcf-4 gene were independently correlated with C-myc gene over expression in HCCs. Conclusions: Our present findings strongly suggest mutations of beta-catenin as well as over expression of beta-catenin and Tcf-4 gene activate the Wnt pathway in HCC independently with the target gene most likely to be C-myc.",

    "Abstract": "Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour-suppressor gene occur in most human colon cancers. Loss of functional APC protein results in the accumulation of beta-catenin. Mutant forms of beta-catenin have been discovered in colon cancers that retain wild-type APC genes, and also in melanomas, medulloblastomas, prostate cancer and gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas. The accumulation of beta-catenin activates genes that are responsive to transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, with which beta-catenin interacts. Here we show that beta-catenin activates transcription from the cyclin D1 promoter, and that sequences within the promoter that are related to consensus TCF/LEF-binding sites are necessary for activation. The oncoprotein p21ras further activates transcription of the cyclin D1 gene, through sites within the promoter that bind the transcriptional regulators Ets or CREB. Cells expressing mutant beta-catenin produce high levels of cyclin D1 messenger RNA and protein constitutively. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative form of TCF in colon-cancer cells strongly inhibits expression of cyclin D1 without affecting expression of cyclin D2, cyclin E, or cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4 or 6. This dominant-negative TCF causes cells to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; this phenotype can be rescued by expression of cyclin D1 under the cytomegalovirus promoter. Abnormal levels of beta-catenin may therefore contribute to neoplastic transformation by causing accumulation of cyclin D1.",

    "Abstract": "A large number of liver transplants have been performed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and recurrence is increasingly encountered. The recurrence of HCC after liver transplantation is notoriously difficult to manage. We hereby propose multi-disciplinary management with a systematic approach. The patient is jointly managed by the transplant surgeon, physician, oncologist and radiologist. Immunosuppressants should be tapered to the lowest effective dose to protect against rejection. The combination of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor with a reduced calcineurin inhibitor could be considered with close monitoring of graft function and toxicity. Comprehensive staging can be performed by dual-tracer positron emission tomography-computed tomography or the combination of contrast computed tomography and a bone scan. In patients with disseminated recurrence, sorafenib confers survival benefits but is associated with significant drug toxicity. Oligo-recurrence encompasses recurrent disease that is limited in number and location so that loco-regional treatments convey disease control and survival benefits. Intra-hepatic recurrence can be managed with graft resection, but significant operative morbidity is expected. Radiofrequency ablation and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) are effective alternative strategies. In patients with more advanced hepatic disease, regional treatment with trans-arterial chemoembolization or intra-arterial Yttrium-90 can be considered. For patients with extra-hepatic oligo-recurrence, loco-regional treatment can be considered if practical. Patients with more than one site of recurrence are not always contraindicated for curative treatments. Surgical resection is effective for patients with pulmonary oligo-recurrence, but adequate lung function is a pre-requisite. SBRT is a non-invasive and effective modality that conveys local control to pulmonary and skeletal oligo-recurrences.",

Methods: Qualitative and quantitative features of bile duct adenomas (BDAs, n=20), bile duct carcinomas (BDCs, n=16), and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs, n=8) are described in 44 cats. Results: There was an overlap in CEUS qualitative features between different histotypes, both in wash-in and wash-out phases. Distinction between different neoplasms based only on the CEUS qualitative features was not possible. At peak of enhancement, the BDAs, BDCs and HCCs showed a large range of echogenicities, from hypoenhancement to hyperenhancement, in comparison to the liver parenchyma. Eight of 20 BDAs showed inhomogeneous hyperenhancement during wash-in, which is a feature reported as typical of malignant lesions in dogs. BDC had a significantly faster wash-in compared with both BDA and HCC but the diagnostic accuracy of all the included quantitative variables was only moderate. No significant differences in the wash-out quantitative features of BDA and BDC were evident. Conclusion: There is poor evidence that CEUS may be used to distinguish between different primary hepatobiliary neoplasms in cats.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: We aimed to study green-synthesized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) from Maclura tricuspidata (MT) root (MTR), stem (MTS), leaf (MTL), and fruit (MTF) extracts and evaluate their anti-metastatic properties in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Maclura tricuspidata belongs to the Moraceae family and is widely used as a traditional medicinal plant given its biological activities. Methods: We quantified the phenolic and flavonoid contents, reducing capacity, and antioxidant activity of all four extracts. The facile and optimum synthesis of MT-GNPs was visualized using UV-vis spectra and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Surface morphology, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of MT-GNPs were assessed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The crystallized gold pattern of MT-GNPs was evaluated using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The functionalizing ligands of MT-extracts and MT-GNPs were determined using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The photocatalytic capabilities of MT-GNPs were assessed by measuring the reduction of rhodamine B and methylene blue. Cell viability assay was detected using Cell Counting Kit-8 solution. Anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects were assessed using cell migration and invasion assays. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and phospholipase D (PLD) enzymatic activities were measured using gelatin zymography and Amplex Red PLD assay, respectively. Western blotting and luciferase assay were used to detect protein expression. Results: All extracts had high phenolic and flavonoid contents and strong antioxidant and reducing capacities. Results from UV-Vis spectra, DLS, HR-TEM, EDS, XRD, and FT-IR showed the successful formation of MT-GNP with surface morphology, crystallinity, reduction capacity, capsulation, and stabilization. MTR-GNPs and MTS-GNPs had better catalytic activities than MTL-GNPs and MTF-GNPs for reduction of methylene blue and rhodamine B. Moreover, MTS-GNPs and MTR-GNPs exhibited the highest anti-migratory and anti-invasive potential and seemed to be more biologically active than the MTS and MTR extracts. Treatment with MT-GNPs decreased the enzymatic activity, translation levels of MMP-9 and PLD1. Our results showed that MTS-GNPs and MTR-GNPs could dramatically reverse transforming growth factor-β-induced vimentin and N-cadherin upregulation and E-cadherin downregulation. Conclusion: The application of GNPs as a potential treatment approach for hepatocellular carcinoma can improve therapeutic efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in codon 72 of the TP53 gene (rs1042522) and in the promoter region of the MDM2 gene (SNP309; rs2279744) have been shown to play a role in the predisposition to many cancers. However, these findings were inconsistent in other tumor types, and ethnicity is suspected to be a critical factor influencing the effects of these SNPs on the cancer risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether these functional SNPs were associated with an enhanced risk of liver tumorigenesis in Moroccan patients. We have genotyped both polymorphisms in 96 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 222 controls without HCC matched for age, gender and ethnicity by PCR-RFLP confirmed by sequencing. A joint effect between the MDM2 and TP53 polymorphisms and an increased risk of liver cancer was detected, with the odds ratio for the presence of both MDM2 309GG and TP53 72Pro/Pro genotypes being 10 (95% confidence interval 0.39-255.55). Interestingly, a significant increase in the HCC risk was observed when at least two deleterious alleles were present, indicating an allele dosage effect. There was no evidence for any association with early age of HCC onset when deleterious alleles of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 Arg72Pro where present. Our findings suggest that the combination of TP53 72Pro and MDM2 309G polymorphisms enhance the risk of developing HCC. These results deserve further confirmation in other populations.",

Other than in BAP1 familial studies, nonmesothelial neoplasms in individuals with MM has not been comprehensively assessed. Objective: - To assess the spectrum and prevalence of nonmesothelial neoplasms in individuals with MM. Design: - Individuals with MM and second neoplasms were identified from a database of 3900 MM cases. The expected prevalence of each type of neoplasm was calculated and compared with the actual prevalence in the study population using available Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data and other published data. Results: - Two hundred seventy nonmesothelial neoplasms were identified in 241 individuals (6% of the study population) with MM. Prostate adenocarcinoma was most common. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, lung carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, breast carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma, meningioma, pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, ocular melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, liposarcoma, and Wilms tumor all were more prevalent than expected. Conclusions: - Nonmesothelial neoplasms are uncommon in individuals with MM, but certain tumor types are increased in prevalence. In an unselected study population with respect to BAP1 status, the prevalence of several tumor types described in BAP1 mutation carriers, including lung carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, breast carcinoma, meningioma, pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, and ocular melanoma, was increased.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/aims: From June of 2016, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-based allocation system replaced the Child- Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score-based system for organ allocation liver in Korea. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in outcomes and arising issues before and after the implementation of the MELD system. Methods: From June 2014 to June 2018, 129 patients were selected from recipients who underwent deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) in Seoul National University Hospital. Pediatric cases were excluded. According to the allocation system, patients were divided into two groups (52 in the MELD group and 77 in the CTP group). Results: MELD scores of the two groups differed significantly (37.8 ± 2.0 in the MELD group vs. 31.0 ± 8.2 in the CTP group; p = 0.001). The etiology of patients was changed for liver transplantation. The proportion of alcoholic liver cirrhosis increased in the era of the MELD allocation system. However, proportions of hepatitis B related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were decreased. Six-month mortality rate of the MELD group was 25.0%, which was higher than that (11.7%) of the CTP group (p = 0.022). The 90-day complication rate was significantly higher in the MELD group than in the CTP group (11.5% vs. 2.6%; p = 0.040). Conclusions: When the MELD allocation system was used to distribute livers to severely ill patients, it resulted in poorer outcomes after surgery and higher proportion of alcoholic cirrhosis. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the MELD allocation system so that outcomes after DDLT could be improved.",
